chairman's statement
I	am	pleased	to	present	the	Group's	final	results	for	the	financial	year	
ended 31 December 2009. 
Financial results
Trading
Despite the global economic climate, the Group delivered a 28% 
increase 	 in 	 sales 	 in 	 the 	 year 	 to 	  18.9 	 million 	 (2008: 	  14.7 	 million) 	 and 	
g r o s s 	 p r o fi t 	 s h o w e d 	 a 	 1 0 % 	 i n c r e a s e 	 t o 	   4 . 6 	 m i l l i o n 	 ( 2 0 0 8 : 	   4 . 2 	 m i l l i o n ) .	
The sales increase has been largely driven by the Asian operations, 
which	now	represent	34%	(2008:	20%)	of	Group	sales.
The Group has suffered a recession-driven sales mix shift that has 
brought 	 down 	 our 	 gross 	 profit 	 margin 	 from 	 28% 	 in 	 2008 	 to 	 24% 	 in 	 2009. 	
A 	 r e d u c t i o n 	 i n 	 a f fi l i a t e 	 m a r k e t i n g 	 c o m m i s s i o n s 	 g e n e r a t e d 	 b y 	 c o n s u m e r

of	search	engine	marketing	services,	a	lower	margin	offering.	
The	impact	of	this	sales	mix	change	on	gross	profitability	is	evident	
across the Group but most evident in our more established Australian 
business.	As	a	result	gross	profit	in	Australia	fell	for	the	y e a r 	by	5.4%.	
This	fall	was	more	than	offset	by	a	61%	increase	in	gross	profit	from	
Asia	leaving	the	region	representing	39%	(2008:	25%).
Other	administrative	costs	have	seen	a	5%	increase	in	the	period	
to	 6.3	million	(2008:	 6.0	million).	This	has	been	driven	by	a	16%	
increase in operating business costs, slightly offset by a 13% reduction 
in central costs. Central costs consist of Group management, the

the	finance,	human	resources	and	technical	functions.
As	a	result	of	the	above,	the	Group	as	a	whole	delivered	a	3%	
reduction	in	loss	from	operations	of	 2.36	million	for	the	period	
(2008:	loss	 2.43	million).	
Within the year the Group's commitment to return Asia Digital 
to	profitable	trading	has	led	to	certain	initiatives	being	suspended	
or	terminated	as	at	the	end	of	the	first	half	of	the	year .	In	addition,	
cost savings have been facilitated by a management restructure 
in the third quarter leaving a smaller senior team, more appropriate 
to the current business size.

to	profitable	trading	throughout	the	fourth	quarter .
Working capital
The	Group's	trading	losses,	combined	with	current	macro	economic	
factors, 	 has 	 put 	 a 	 strain 	 on 	 working 	 capital. 	 Accordingly , 	 continued 	
emphasis	was	placed	on	working	capital	management	with	increased	
attention 	 to 	 credit 	 control 	 and 	 taking 	 full 	 advantage 	 of 	 suppliers' 	 credit	
terms	where	possible.
W ithin 	 the 	 first 	 quarter 	 of 	 the 	 year , 	 the 	 Group 	 arranged 	 a 	 sales 	 ledger 	
credit	facility	with	Commonwealth	Bank	in	Australia.	This	was	used	
throughout 	 the 	 year 	 and 	 we 	 anticipate 	 this 	 will 	 continue 	 to 	 be 	 used.
In 	 addition, 	 in 	 May 	 2009, 	 the 	 Group 	 raised 	  500,000 	 by 	 way 	 of 	 a	
convertible loan note, issued to a company controlled by John Porter, 
the Group's former Chairman.
In October 2009, as a result of the tightening of supplier terms from 
one of the Group's largest suppliers and to further strengthen the 
balance	sheet,	the	Group	successfully	raised	 1.275	million	(gross	
of	expenses)	via	a	placing	of	new	ordinary	shares.
A	key	focus	of	the	Group	was	to	achieve	a	positive	trading	cash	flow	
at	the	earliest	opportunity .	Though	this	has	now	been	achieved,	there

Group offering
The Group continues to operate business units covering three distinct areas 
of supply in the digital advertising sector. These businesses are currently 
managed along geographical lines but it is anticipated that as the Group 
evolves 	 a 	 more 	 business 	 unit 	 based 	 management 	 approach 	 will 	 be 	 adopted.

largest	part	of	the	Group	in	terms	of	headcount,	sales	and	profitability .
Deploy Digital - a digital communications planning and implementation 
agency. This part of the Group is not material in the sales mix, 
is 	 operating 	 at 	 or 	 around 	 breakeven 	 and 	 has 	 no 	 dedicated 	 resource.
Markets
Steven Noble, a respected commentator from Forrester Research, 
concluded	in	his	2009	paper	on	Asia	P acific	Interactive	Marketing	
Predictions	that	 AP AC's	incredible	rates	of	economic	growth,	
urbanisation and Internet adoption merely hint at the digital 
transformation	that's	underway	in	this	region .
The	Group's	Asian	expansion	was	originally	driven	by	recognition	
that	the	region	was	experiencing	material	growth	in	internet	users	
and	digital	advertising	spend,	combined	with	a	limited	supply	
of	experienced	digital	marketers.
The 	 region 	 currently 	 has 	 755 	 million 	 people 	 online 	 and 	 represented 	 42%	
of 	 world 	 internet 	 users. 	 F urthermore, 	 the 	 region 	 generated 	 $14 	 billon 	 of	
internet advertising or 23% of global internet advertising spend (Source: 
InternetW orldStats;	ZenithOptimedia	December	2009	Report).
Asia	P acific	represented	only	1.1%	of	global	digital	advertising	in	2000	
and 	 this 	 grew 	 to 	 13.4% 	 in 	 2009. 	 It 	 is 	 expected 	 to 	 grow 	 to 	 17.3% 	 in 	 2012. 	
O n l y 	 1 9 % 	 o f 	 t h e 	 A s i a 	 P a c i fi c 	 p o p u l a t i o n 	 w e r e 	 o n l i n e 	 i n 	 2 0 0 9 	 c o m p a r e d 	to	
74%	in	the	USA	and	76%	in	the	UK .	This	suggests	that	further	material	
growth	can	be	expected,	which	will	in	turn	stimulate	further	significant	
growth	in	digital	advertising.
Only	1%	of	total	advertising	budgets	in	the	region	were	allocated	
to	the	internet	in	2000	when	the	internet	reach	was	at	25%	of	the	
population.	By	2009,	internet	reach	was	at	76%	of	the	population	
and	the	percentage	of	advertising	allocated	online	rose	to	26%.	
Though	the	supply	side	has	developed	since	2007	when	the	Group	
entered	the	South-east	Asian	market,	the	management	considers	the	
market	opportunity	to	remain	attractive.	The	core	skill	sets	of	the	two	
main	 businesses	 DGM	 and	 AKTIV	 are	 highly	 relevant	 to	 market	 needs.

of	Asia	P acific,	and	less	than	2.5%	of	Asia	internet	advertising	spend.
W ithin	this	small	part	of	the	regional	market,	and	in	the	midst	of	
a global recessionary climate, the Group has extended an existing 
successful business from Australia into India and the South-east Asia 
region proving concept, building a brand and returning the Group 
as	a	whole	to	positive	earnings	trading	throughout	the	fourth	quarter	
of 2009.
F urther	material	growth	in	digital	advertising	spend	is	expected	within	
current	operating	territories,	however	launching	in	additional	territories
