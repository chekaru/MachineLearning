 02 QUANTICA PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006
Chairman and Chief Executive's Statement
Introduction
Your Company has gone through a year of significant 
transformation and I am pleased to say the result is that we 
now have a focused professional services recruitment group. 
We also have a strong balance sheet having moved from a net 
debt position to having a significant cash asset which should 
allow us to deliver significant shareholder value in the year 
ahead and will facilitate the strategic development of the Group.
During the period we disposed of our Healthcare Division and our 
Training Division for a total net cash consideration of  16.5m.
Financial highlights
On 26 July 2006 the Company announced that it had changed 
its accounting reference date from 1 December 2006 to 
31 December 2006 for the current year and annually thereafter. 
Consequently these results are for the 13 month period ended 
31 December 2006, with the 2005 numbers quoted for the 
12 month period to 2 December 2005.
Sales for the 13 month period to 31 December 2006 increased 
by 25% (over the prior 12 month period) to  48.8m (2005:  38.9m). 
Net fee income increased by 48% to  24.5m (2005:  16.5m). 
Operating profit before amortisation of goodwill, Long Term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP) charges and exceptional items decreased 
by 10% to  3.7m (2005:  4.1m). Pre-tax profit increased by 188% 
to  7.5m (2005:  2.6m). The substantial increase in pre-tax profit 
is primarily due to the profit on the sale of the Healthcare and 
Training businesses. Net cash inflow from operating activities 
(pre exceptional items) decreased by 20% to  2.0m (2005:  2.5m) 
and net cash at 31 December 2006 stood at  9.1m (2005:  5.0m 
net debt).
Adjusted earnings per share (before LTIP charges, exceptional 
items, amortisation of goodwill and profit on sale of businesses) 
decreased by 40% to 3.72p (2005: 6.25p). Basic earnings per 
share for the period after LTIP charges, exceptional items, 
amortisation of goodwill and profit on sale of businesses 
increased by 147% to 10.29p (2005: 4.16p).
The 2006 numbers for the 13 month period to 31 December 2006 
are distorted by the inclusion of two December trading months. 
Therefore in order to give a more meaningful comparison versus 
the 2005 comparative, the table below shows unaudited turnover, 
net fee income and operating profit for the 12 month periods 
to 31 December 2005 and 2006 split between continued and 
discontinued businesses:
    2006 2005 
     '000  '000
Turnover
Continued    26,720 16,363
Discontinued    18,780 23,316
Total    45,500 39,679
Net fee income
Continued    13,660 7,645

Operating profit
Continued    2,064 1,235
Discontinued    1,667 2,777
Total    3,731 4,012
 We have a strong balance sheet having moved 
from a net debt position to having a significant 
cash asset.

Business review
During the period Quantica operated through three divisions; 
Professional Services, Healthcare and Training. Comments below 
refer to performance for the 12 months to 31 December 2006.
Professional Services Division
Our Professional Services Division consists of a number 
of specialist brands providing middle management 
recruitment services to commerce and industry throughout 
the UK. The Division operates out of 15 offices including 
London, Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester and employs 
approximately 150 staff, of which well over two-thirds are 
directly involved in sales.
The division offers contract and permanent recruitment 
solutions to a wide range of industry sectors including 
business support services, technology, outsourcing, leisure, 
finance, manufacturing, legal, supply chain, public sector, 
energy and utilities, retail, food and many more.
Clients range from small, high-growth businesses to 
multi-national, blue chip organisations. In addition, other key 
services include advertised assignments, corporate mapping 
and executive research, database search, internet advertising, 
psychometric and ability testing, response handling and 
targeted head hunting.
Net fee income for the division was up 80% to  13.7m 
(2005:  7.6m) and operating profit contribution was up 75% 
to  2.1m (2005:  1.2m), reflecting a full year contribution 
from the acquisition of RK Group.
Healthcare Division
Quantica Healthcare is a supplier of short term care workers 
to localised care homes and also specialises in the recruitment 
of qualified social workers.
On 11 October 2006 Quantica announced the disposal of 
Quantica Healthcare for  4.5m in cash to Advantage Healthcare 
Group Limited. The disposal was completed on 6 November 2006. 
The figures quoted below for 2006 are therefore for the eleven 
month period ended 6 November 2006 as compared to a full year 
for the 2005 comparatives.
Net fee income to 6 November 2006 was  3.1m (2005:  3.9m) 
and operating profit contribution was  0.9m (2005:  1.4m).
Training Division
Quantica Training offers a broad range of Government-funded 
vocational work-based training programmes leading to 
nationally recognised qualifications.
On 3 July 2006 Quantica completed the acquisition of 
Interactive Training Management Limited (ITM) for a total 
consideration of  0.4m in cash and  0.2m satisfied by the 
issue of 312,500 new ordinary shares in Quantica to the 
vendors. The acquisition built upon our existing presence in 
the North West in a training market we felt offered existing 
opportunities for growth and consolidation.

Business review continued
Training Division continued
On 11 December 2006 Quantica announced the disposal of 
Quantica Training (including ITM) to Carter and Carter Group 
plc for  12.7m in cash.
Net fee income to 11 December 2006 was  6.0m (2005:  5.2m) 
and operating profit contribution was  0.7m (2005:  1.4m).
Cancellation of listing on the official list and admission to AIM
On 11 October 2006 the Company announced its intention 
to cancel the listing of its ordinary shares of 1p (ordinary shares) 
on the Official List and to apply for the ordinary shares to be 
admitted to trading on AIM.
The Directors believe that given the Company's size and 
strategy, AIM is a more appropriate market for the trading 
of the ordinary shares. The Directors also believe that AIM 
provides a more flexible regulatory regime, allowing the 
Company to be able to agree and execute transactions 
more quickly should any acquisition or other development 
opportunities arise in the future. The Board envisages no 
alteration in the standards of reporting and governance 
which the Company has always maintained. Thus, the 
Directors believe that the Company will continue to be 
attractive to institutional investors while tax benefits 
potentially available to investors in shares listed on AIM 
will also make Quantica more attractive to retail investment 
funds and retail investors. Admission took place and 
dealings commenced on AIM on 5 December 2006.
Cancellation of options under LTIP
Following the decision made by the Board in December 2006, 
the Board of Quantica announced on 10 January 2007 its 
intention to cancel, with immediate effect, all of the LTIP 
options over ordinary shares awarded to the Executive 
Directors of the Company under the Quantica LTIP .
Due to the changing nature of the Group and its current 
strategy the Board believed that the LTIP no longer provided 
an appropriate mechanism to incentivise and retain key 
members of staff.
Dividends and share buy back
The Board is proposing to increase the final dividend to 
1.40p (2005: 1.30p) per ordinary share for the 13 month period 
to 31 December 2006 which, if approved by shareholders, 
would give a total dividend for the year of 1.40p (2005: 1.30p). 
The dividend will become payable on 29 May 2007 to shareholders 
on the register on 27 April 2007. The Company has a progressive 
dividend policy and it is our intention to pay dividends at 
a level we believe is sustainable, reflecting our confidence 
in the business going forward.
On 11 January 2007 the Company purchased for cancellation 
6,629,184 ordinary shares at 29p per ordinary share. Following 
this purchase the Company has 59,662,664 ordinary shares in 
issue. We will continue to consider the use of share repurchases 
as an additional mechanism for returning surplus cash to 
shareholders where appropriate.

We will be seeking shareholder approval for a renewal of the 
authority to repurchase up to 20% of the issued share capital 
of the Company at the Annual General Meeting on 17 May 2007.
Employees
I would like to thank everyone for their hard working during 
2006. I hope the newcomers to the Group have enjoyed their 
first full year with Quantica and I hope they have many more 
successful years with us in the future. I would particularly like 
to thank the staff of Quantica Healthcare and Quantica Training 
and I wish them well for the future.
Board of Directors
On 7 February 2006 we announced that John Bowman had 
been appointed to the Board of Quantica as an Executive 
Director with immediate effect.
On 13 September 2006 we announced that Richard Robinson 
was, for family health reasons, stepping down as an Executive 
Director with immediate effect. Richard did agree to continue 
in his role as Chairman of Robinson Keane Search and Selection, 
part of the enlarged Professional Services Division.
We hope that in the future Richard may once again be able 
to play a larger role in the Group.
Strategy
The disposal of Quantica Healthcare and Quantica Training 
represents a further step in Quantica's transition to become 
a recruitment company which is wholly focused on the 
professional services sectors. Together the transactions 
have significantly changed the financial strength, shape and 
structure of the Group. 
The Board has recently been taking the opportunity to 
review its strategy and operations with the aim of optimising 
shareholder value. This review is at an advanced stage of 
planning and it is expected that the Board will announce 
the outcome of that review at or before the Annual General 
Meeting on 17 May 2007. 
Outlook
The current year has started well. Businesses have performed 
ahead of internal expectations in quarter one of our new 
financial year and the markets in which we operate continue to 
be robust.
