 Chairman's Statement

Ramco Energy plc
Dear Shareholders,
The past eighteen months have been
an immensely difficult period in the
Company's history as a result of the
huge challenges posed by the
production problems in the Seven
Heads gas field offshore Ireland -
about which much has been written
already. It doesn't really get much
tougher than this and it is a tribute to
our team that we have not only
managed to survive, what to many
companies would have been a
terminal event, but have emerged with
a turnaround plan in place based on
an attractive portfolio of largely
carried exploration interests, support
from the Irish government, effective
agreements entered into with the
Company's lenders and  1 million of
additional capital invested by existing
shareholders. 
Financial Results
Group turnover for 2004 totalled
 36.9 million, up from  20.8 million
in 2003. This significant increase is
attributable to gas sales from Seven
Heads, which commenced in the last
quarter of 2003. 
A group operating profit of  598,000
was recorded in 2004 compared to an
operating loss of  105 million in
2003. The 2003 results included
exceptional items totalling  99
million, of which  93 million related
to an impairment provision against the
carrying value of our Seven Heads gas
interest.
An exceptional credit of  5.7 million
has been recorded in 2004 reflecting
the accounting treatment of further
depletion and impairment of Seven
Heads borne by the non-recourse
finance provider.
Administrative expenses in 2004 fell
to  1.4 million from  1.8 million in
2003, reflecting cost savings
implemented following the problems
at Seven Heads. Exchange losses also
reduced to  103,000 from  686,000
in the previous year. Net interest
payable of  4.6 million was incurred
compared with net interest income of
 738,000 in 2003.
The overall result, before tax, for the
year is a loss of  3.3 million, a tax
charge of  91,000 takes the after tax
loss up to  3.4 million, compared
with  76.7 million in 2003 when we
reflected the impairment provision
against our Seven Heads gas field.
At 31 December 2004 Group cash
balances were  3.3 million and since
the year end we have completed a
placing of 3 million new shares at 34p
raising  1 million after expenses. As
previously announced we have
recently reached extended waiver
agreements with our Bankers and
a major creditor. These agreements
defer loan repayments totalling
 13.55 million to allow asset sales to
be concluded, which may include
some or all of the assets of the Oil
Services division.
Seven Heads
Since the start of October 2004,
production from the Seven Heads gas
field has been profiled to allow greater
volumes of gas to be produced and
sold during the winter months, when
gas prices are generally at their peak.
This profiling worked successfully over
the winter and, as planned,
production has now been reduced to
4 mmscfd. Ernst and Young have
recently been appointed to assist
in the sale of our 86.5% interest in
this field. 
Exploration Interests
Ireland:
We continue to be enthusiastic about
our exploration interests in Ireland
which include a Frontier Exploration
Licence in the Donegal Basin, three
Licensing Options where we are
exploring for gas in the Celtic Sea,
and our Seven Heads Oil Licensing
Option. We believe there is
substantial potential within these
properties where the geology is
fundamentally different from the
Seven Heads gas field. Ireland remains
an outstanding market for both oil and
gas with a stable and supportive
government and an attractive fiscal
regime. I believe that there is
significant value to be gained from our
continued participation in Irish
exploration where we retain a strong,
strategic position. 
An independent evaluation of our
Donegal and Celtic Sea exploration 3
Ramco Energy plc
properties has been completed by
Scott Pickford. Their work confirms
Ramco's estimates that the two largest
structures on the Donegal block
contain unrisked gas initially in place
(GIIP) of 1,535 bcf and 791 bcf
respectively. Scott Pickford's work also
confirms Ramco's unrisked GIIP
estimate totalling 471 bcf for the
Celtic Sea Licensing Options. Ramco's
net interest in these unrisked GIIP
estimates totals 837 bcf.
Ireland - Donegal Basin
We have worked over the last year to
progress our Donegal acreage and this
culminated in the award in January
2005 of a Frontier Exploration
Licence, covering an area of 101,000
acres. Within the first two years of the
Frontier Licence, an exploration well
will be drilled to test the Triassic
Sherwood Sandstone reservoir in the
large Inishbeg Prospect, which lies in
water depth of around 320ft. Ramco
has entered into a farm-out agreement
and will be carried through the costs
of the first well retaining a 19.25%
interest. The Sherwood Sandstone is
the productive reservoir in the Corrib
Gas Field, which lies on trend to the
southwest, and is currently under
development. There are also
additional follow-on opportunities on
the acreage, which will be addressed
if there are encouraging results from
the Inishbeg well. 
Ireland - Celtic Sea 
Work has continued throughout the
year on our Midleton, Rosscarbery
and East Kinsale Licensing Options
and is now in the final stages. The
recently granted extensions to these
Licensing Options allow us until the
end of the year to decide which of the
prospects merits drilling.
Ireland - Seven Heads Oil
Geological and reservoir engineering
studies are nearing completion on the
oil accumulations lying between
4,500ft and 7,500ft beneath the Seven
Heads gas field.
Ramco's share of costs has been
carried by Island Oil and Gas plc,
who also have the option to carry
Ramco through the drilling of an
appraisal well to earn a 44.4%
interest, leaving Ramco with 29.6%.
Bulgaria
Together with our partner and
operator, Anschutz, we announced in
January that we had farmed-out our 
A-Lovech licence to Chimimport JSC
of Bulgaria. The A-Lovech block lies
approximately 80 km to the north east
of Sofia and covers 3,558 sq km.
Chimimport will earn a 45% interest
in the acreage by completing 570 sq
km of 3D seismic. The seismic
acquisition programme is aimed at
multiple geological targets and will
commence later this year. Once the
seismic is completed the interests in
the acreage will be Chimimport 45%,
Anschutz 44% and Ramco 11%.
Following completion of a number of
geophysical and geological studies
over the past few years, the licence
area continues to increase in
attractiveness, with both oil and gas
prospects. The proximity of this block
to major gas pipeline infrastructure is
significant since it would facilitate the
rapid development of any gas
discovery into a network linking
several East European countries.
Assuming positive results from the
new 3D seismic, it is likely that
the partnership will drill during 2006. 
Montenegro
In a recent restructuring agreement
with Hellenic Petroleum SA (Hellenic)
of Greece, Ramco agreed to exchange
its interests in Montenegro for an
option to rejoin the acreage after the
first exploration well is completed. 
Following the drilling of an
exploration well on the acreage
Ramco will have 120 days to elect to
rejoin the acreage for an interest of up
to 15% in all of the blocks. Ramco's
past costs in Montenegro will be taken
into consideration in the calculation
of the exercise price for the interest
in the event that we elect to exercise
the option.
Oil Services
Results from the Oil Services division
exceeded our expectations for the
year as a result of improved
performance from our pipe coating joint venture, a full year's trading at
our pipe-cleaning unit in Japan and
increased activity within our
Norwegian operations.
Our Badentoy operations, covering
both logistics and tubular cleaning
and coating, performed satisfactorily
and marginally exceeded
expectations. Since the year end this
location has benefited from a three
year extension to a cleaning and
logistics contract with BP.
Both our Norwegian plants in
Stavanger and Flor  performed well
during 2004 with revenues and
contributions at these locations ahead
of expectations for the year. Work at
both locations is secured under
contract with key customers until late
2005 and early 2006.
Our Japanese facility, which had been
shut down for much of 2002 and
2003, enjoyed a full year's operations
in 2004 as a result of strong demand
for the type of pipe produced at the
mill in Japan where our plant is based.
Our pipe coating joint venture in
Hartlepool had a successful year and
completed coating contracts for
pipelines in West Africa, the
Caribbean and the Middle East,
together with projects in the UK for
Shell, BP and Venture Petroleum.
During the latter part of 2004 the joint
venture upgraded its Hartlepool
stockyards and completed the transfer
of Transco's strategic and surplus pipe
stocks to this new storage facility. In
future our joint venture will manage
this inventory along with new material
receipts and the issue of pipe stock to
project locations.
This inventory management concept is
similar to the type of contract
successfully undertaken for North Sea
customers by our Tubular Services
Division.
We expect to see a continued and
steady improvement in tubular activity
levels over the coming year where our
long term contract and call-off
arrangements with a wide range
of customers will serve to
support our Badentoy plant and
logistics operations. 
On the pipeline side of the business,
we started 2005 with a strong order
book with work on projects for both
the UK and overseas. In addition we
will benefit from a full year's turnover
from the logistics operations which
now support Transco pipe projects.
Litigation
The appeal and related proceedings
arising from the judgement awarded to
Anglo Dutch in the Texas State Court
continue. The appeal and the
plaintiffs' cross-appeal, to the
Fourteenth Texas Court of Appeals
were heard in Houston on 26 April
2005 and the court's decision is
awaited. This process may be followed
by a further appeal by either party to
the Texas Supreme Court.
Proceedings were raised by Anglo
Dutch in the Court of Session,
Edinburgh, with a view to enforcing
the Texas judgement in Scotland, but
further procedure has been
suspended, pending the review by the
Texas Court of Appeals of an order
fixing the amount of a bond which, if
lodged by Ramco in Houston, would
suspend any enforcement. 
Outlook
It's extremely encouraging for us now
to have in sight a solution to the
problems created by Seven Heads. Our
strategy, through the process agreed
with our Bankers is to seek buyers for
our interest in the Seven Heads gas
field and some of our other assets. The
objective is to be debt free by the end
of 2005, and participating in a drilling
program in 2006 through which Ramco
is largely carried, greatly reducing
financial commitments. The team is
re-energised and I wish to thank them
for their true grit  during the past year.
It is a privilege for me to be leading
that group forward.
