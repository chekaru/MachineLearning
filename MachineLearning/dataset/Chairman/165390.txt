Chairman's statement
Renishaw's markets 
exhibit attractive, 
long-term 
structural growth 
drivers with 
continuing global 
investment in 
production systems 
and processes.
Overview
I am pleased to announce a record  
set of Group results in terms of both 
revenue and profit for the year ended  
30th June 2012; a year of further  
progress and growth.
Total Group revenue for the year was 
 331.9m, 15% ahead of the  288.7m  
for last year. All geographic areas saw 
good progress, with growth of 18% in  
the Americas (revenue of  76.8m), 14%  
in the Far East ( 130.2m), 12% in Europe 
( 95.7m) and 28% in the UK ( 18.9m) 
benefitting from a full year's trading from 
acquisitions. In the Far East we saw  
a strong recovery in the final quarter  
of the year, principally due to revenue  
from China.
Group profit before tax for the year was 
 86.0m, compared with  80.4m last year 
(excluding a  1.7m exceptional item), 
an increase of 7%.
Adjusted earnings per share were 95.6p, 
an increase of 8% over last year's adjusted 
earnings per share of 88.5p. Reported 
earnings per share for the year were 95.6p 
(2011 90.8p).
Segmental analysis
Metrology
Revenue from our metrology business  
was extremely strong in the last quarter  
of the year, resulting in revenue for the  
full year of  305.8m, compared with 
 267 .0m last year, an increase of 15%. 
Operating profit was  91.8m, compared 
with  87 .7m in 2011. 
All product lines reported growth, apart 
from encoder products which experienced 
a slowdown during the year but a recovery 
in the final quarter. The machine tool 
and calibration product lines performed 
particularly well and there was strong 
interest for our Equator product which is 
gaining wider exposure and acceptance.
Measurement Devices Limited (MDL) and 
MTT Investments Limited (the latter now 
operating as the additive manufacturing 
product line), acquired last year, also 
contributed to the growth in this segment. 
In June an additional 17% shareholding  
in MDL was acquired, bringing the 
Company's shareholding to 66%.
New product releases during the period 
include the RESOLUTE  ETR, an 
absolute encoder with extended 
temperature range for operation in very 
cold environments such as aerospace; the 
XR20-W rotary axis calibrator; the REVO
 
 
SFP1 surface finish probe and a multi-axis 
option for our Productivity+  software.

On 3rd February 2012 the Group acquired 
Thomas Engineering and Construction 
Limited, an MDL distributor and services 
provider based in Canada, for the sum  
of  0.7m, of which  0.2m was paid at the 
date of acquisition and the balance is 
payable over the following two years. 
On 26th April 2012 the Group acquired 
R&R Sales LLC (R&R ) for the sum of 
 2.6m plus additional payments based on 
future performance. R&R is a US-based 
supplier of fixtures for the measurement 
and inspection market. The acquisition of 
R&R will provide fixturing solutions for our 
Equator gauge and enable R&R to expand 
further by utilising Renishaw's worldwide 
sales and distribution network.
Healthcare 
Revenue from our healthcare business  
for the year was  26.1m, compared with 
 21.7m last year, an increase of 20%. 
Spectroscopy sales were at a record  
level, driven by an increasing range of 
applications in nanotechnology, advanced 
materials and life sciences, and there was 
also growth in the dental and neurological 
product lines.
During the year, the Board refocused part 
of the healthcare activities to a smaller 
number of projects, particularly in our 
neurological products line, and withdrew 
from the supply of radio frequency coils  
for use in MRI scanning research which 
was no longer considered core to our 
business strategy. 
Our spectroscopy product line introduced 
a new integrated Raman/Atomic Force 
Microscope package and the neurological 
product line saw further sales of its 
neuromate
 
 surgical robot used for 
neurosurgical procedures with the UK's 
first Stereo Electro Encephalography 
procedures being carried out to aid the 
treatment of chronic epilepsy at Frenchay 
Hospital in Bristol. The next generation of 
neuroinspire
 
 surgical planning software 
achieved CE approval in January 2012.
The continuing significant expenditure  
on research and development in this 
segment resulted in an operating loss of 
 8.6m, compared with a loss of  8.4m  
for last year. The Board is targeting that  
the Healthcare segment will move into 
profit in the next two years.

Investment for growth
The Group continues to invest for 
long-term growth and during the year 
has invested  30.3m (2011  16.5m)  
on facilities, plant and machinery and 
information technology capacity to provide 
the platform to accommodate growth 
expectations:
  In September 2011, the Group 
completed its purchase of the premises 
at Miskin, South Wales. 68,500 sq ft  
(of a total of 461,000 sq ft) has been 
refurbished and new CNC machine 
tools have now been brought 
into production. 
  In York, construction of 20,000 sq ft  
of new premises for occupation by MDL 
has begun, with completion due at the 
end of this calendar year.
  In Dublin, planning consent has been 
received for a 26,000 sq ft extension  
of our manufacturing facility. This is 
due to be completed by the end of 
this calendar year.
  At New Mills and Charfield, planning 
consent has been granted for 
230,000 sq ft and 50,000 sq ft 
respectively, primarily to provide 
additional research and development 
space on a phased basis.
  In Slovenia, a new 30,000 sq ft  
facility has been recently completed  
and occupied by our associate 
company, RLS.
During the year the Group expended  
a total of  47 .9m (2011  40.0m) 
on engineering including research 
and development, current product 
engineering and manufacturing processes, 
which is planned to increase further in 
the coming year.

Overview Governance Financial statements Performance Shareholder information
We continue to grow and expand  
our global marketing and distribution 
activities to support the new products 
introduced:
  The Group has established a new 
subsidiary company in Mexico to  
market and support the Group's 
products in that country and other 
Central American countries. 
  We have expanded our working 
premises in Germany, Brazil and  
China, and have refurbished and 
re-occupied a 16,000 sq ft building  
in Schaumburg, USA.
  Our Canadian subsidiary has acquired, 
refurbished and moved into a larger 
17 ,000 sq ft facility in Mississauga, 
Toronto.
  Our Spanish subsidiary has relocated  
to newly acquired premises in Barcelona 
and, in Italy, our subsidiary purchased 
the property it has occupied for a 
number of years.
Balance sheet  
and working capital
Net cash balances at 30th June 2012 
were  21.1m, compared with  23.7m  
in 2011. In addition, there is an escrow 
account amounting to  11.5m 
(30th June 2011  10.8m) relating to the 
provision of security to the Company's 
defined benefit pension scheme.
The Group has also financed an  
increase of  23.1m in working capital, 
primarily trade receivables resulting  
from exceptionally strong revenue in  
the final quarter.
Directors
David Snowden and Terry Garthwaite  
have each completed nine years on the 
Board and will not be seeking re-election 
at the AGM on 18th October 2012. 
The Board is very grateful for their 
considerable contributions to the Group.
The Board is pleased that Dr David Grant 
has joined the Board with effect from  
25th April 2012 and further appointments 
will be made in due course.
Resolutions to re-elect all continuing 
directors will be put to the AGM.
Employees
The directors thank the Group's 
employees for their continuing support 
and significant contribution during this 
successful year. 
Headcount at the end of June 2012 was 
2,904, an increase of 229 during the year. 
There are currently 182 staff vacancies  
in the Group, of which 118 are in the UK, 
and in common with other UK engineering 
companies Renishaw is continuing  
to experience difficulty in recruiting 
high-calibre engineers.
Awards
The Group has again received  
a number of awards during the year, 
including our 15th Queen's Award for 
Enterprise 2012 in the Innovations 
Category for the SP80 ultra-high 
accuracy analogue scanning probe. 
Outlook
As expected the final quarter of the  
year saw an increase in revenue growth 
and was a record quarter for the Group, 
with revenue of  103m. Renishaw's 
markets exhibit attractive, long-term 
structural growth drivers with continuing 
global investment in production systems 
and processes. The Group therefore 
continues to invest a significant amount  
in R&D, manufacturing, marketing and 
distribution capability with a number of 
initiatives underway. Although the world 
economic outlook is uncertain, the Board 
remains optimistic regarding the Group's 
own future and prospects and expects 
that 2013 will be another year of progress 
for Renishaw.
Dividends
A final dividend of 28.2p per share 
will be paid on 22nd October 2012  
to shareholders on the register on 
21st September 2012.
