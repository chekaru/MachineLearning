 Chairman's 
Statement
Results
I am pleased to report a satisfactory set of results 
for the Group. However, in recent months we 
have faced an accumulation of cost and revenue 
pressures that will, disappointingly, impact our 
profitability in the current year.
Sales volumes continued our pattern of  
unbroken growth, rising 4.1% to 1.52 billion litres 
(2007: 1.46 billion). As a result of rising milk costs, 
revenue rose 19.3% to a record  722.0 million 
(2007:  605.3 million), with revenue per litre  
of liquid milk sold averaging 47.6p per litre  
(2007: 41.5p per litre).
As a result of a non-recurring charge of  
 6.8 million to take account of the regulatory 
penalty agreed with the Office of Fair Trading, 
and other re-organisational costs, our reported 
operating profit fell by 11.3% to  31.6 million 
(2007:  35.7 million). The adjusted operating 
profit, which reflects our underlying  
performance, was up 10.1% to  38.4 million  
(2007:  34.9 million). Our operating profit per 
litre continued to make progress despite a high 
inflationary cost environment and, for the year,  
we achieved 2.53p per litre on an adjusted profit 
basis (2007: 2.39p per litre). 
As a result of a record capital expenditure of  
 63.1 million, our finance costs rose to  2.6 million 
(2007:  1.2 million). Profit before tax fell 15.6%  
to  29.2 million (2007:  34.6 million),  
but, on an adjusted basis, was up 6.4%  
to  36.0 million (2007:  33.8 million). 
Earnings per share declined 19.8% to 26.76p 
(2007: 33.38p). On an adjusted basis, earnings  
per share rose 7.5% to 34.74p (2007: 32.33p).
The net cash from operating activities was 
 52.9 million (2007:  44.1 million), once again 
demonstrating the strong cash flow characteristics 
of the business. This positive cash flow has 
resulted in our net debt at the end of the period 
being lower than anticipated at  39.5 million 
(2007:  7.7 million). Gearing was 28.3%, which 
although up on last year (2007: 5.5%), remains 
low for our sector and allows scope for  
continued growth.
Dividend
The Board has recommended a final dividend  
of 10.00p per share (2007: 9.00p per share)  
which, together with the interim dividend,  
will result in a total dividend payable in respect  
of the year of 14.00p per share (2007: 12.00p per 
share), an increase of 16.7%. Dividend cover on 
adjusted earnings is 2.5 times (2007: 2.7 times). 
The dividend is payable on 18 September 2008 to 
shareholders on the register at 1 August 2008.
Bridgwater Dairy
We are very pleased with the fantastic facility we 
have created at Bridgwater, which we believe to be 
the most modern, efficient and environmentally 
advanced fresh liquid dairy in the world. We are 
currently at the final stages of a feasibility study on 
installing an anaerobic digestion plant that would 
create energy from our waste material.
The previously highlighted delay in commissioning 
the final filling line has resulted in our target 
of achieving full Phase 1 production being 
postponed until late June 2008. Given this delay 
and continuing inflationary pressures, we now 
anticipate the projected Phase 1 final cost to be 
 80 million. We believe this represents good 
value for the Group and we are confident it will 
prove to be an excellent investment. We estimate 
the capital cost to increase the capacity from the 
present 250 million litres per annum to its ultimate 
500 million litres per annum to be approximately 
 20 million, as all the buildings and infrastructure 
have been completed in Phase 1. 
Staff
Given the pressure put on our facilities in advance 
of Bridgwater opening, it is a great credit to our 
employees that they again ensured that service 
levels to all our customers were excellent.
The payout last September from our Save as You 
Earn Scheme was a great financial and morale 
boost for staff. We estimated this was worth  
 5 million to our employees and, given the 
favourable tax treatment associated with schemes 
of this kind, would have meant a tax free windfall 
for the vast majority of our staff who participated  
in the Scheme. 
A further Save as You Earn Scheme has been put 
in place and 1,000 employees have joined this 
Scheme. Our employees also continue to benefit 
from our Share Incentive Scheme that commenced 
in May 2003.
Office of Fair Trading
In December 2007 we announced that we 
had signed an early Resolution Agreement 
with the OFT in relation to its Dairy Retail Price 
Investigation. As part of this agreement, we 
undertook to pay a fine of  6.1 million, which  
is based on the assumption of continued and  
full co-operation with the OFT. A provision for  
this fine, and associated legal costs, totalling  
 6.4 million has therefore been made within  
this year's results. Payment of the fine will not  
take place until the OFT reaches a decision on  
the outstanding case.
As stated previously, all monies paid to Wiseman 
following the Retail Price Initiatives were paid to 
farmers and no profit was generated by Wiseman 
from such initiatives.
The last remaining OFT investigation involving 
the Group relates to the Scottish Middle Ground 
Inquiry, where, in September 2006, the OFT issued 
a provisional Statement of Objections against six 
Scottish dairies claiming that they had entered into 
agreements, or concerted practice, in the supply of 
fresh processed milk over a four year period 2000 
to 2003.
We responded to these allegations, which arose 
primarily from a competitor Claymore Dairies  
(a subsidiary of Arla Foods), in late 2006. The OFT 
recently informed us that it has now provisionally 
decided to close down this long running 
investigation. Whilst we welcome this provisional 
decision, we have always maintained that this case 
should be closed and now await the final decision.
 I am delighted to report a record set of results 
for the Group. The Group has gradually rebuilt 
its operating margin over the last couple of 
years in what is an extremely challenging 
environment. Our ambition remains to maintain 
that recovery over the next few years. 
Alan Wiseman, Chairman
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008 Robert Wiseman Dairies 14 Our own exposure to the commodity market is  
in relation to our bulk cream sales where there  
has been a dramatic fall in returns since late 2007. 
In normal circumstances, this would be addressed 
through a downward milk price adjustment  
(just as higher cream prices meant higher milk 
prices). However, given current concerns over 
supply, this has not been possible. It was therefore 
anticipated that this could be recouped as part 
of the April round of selling prices, but given the 
extent and continuance of this bulk cream revenue 
shortfall, it has not been possible at this stage 
to get a full recovery. This shortfall is estimated 
to reduce operating profit by  3.5 million in the 
current year if bulk cream prices remain at current 
levels and we are not able to recoup this in  
a further selling price review later this year.
The combination of the increase in costs, delayed 
recovery in selling prices and shortfall in bulk 
cream revenues is likely to impact our operating 
profit for the current year in total by up to  
 8.5 million. 
Despite these short-term margin pressures, we 
are confident that the business is in good shape 
with our new Bridgwater facility now operational. 
We strongly believe this will provide us with the 
platform to continue our successful growth in  
the period ahead.

Outlook
During the year we have updated the market  
on a regular basis about the unprecedented cost 
pressure on us from rising HDPE resin, diesel, 
wage and utility costs. Over the last few months 
we have been working to seek recovery of these 
higher costs from our customer base. In our Pre 
Close Trading Statement on 27 March 2008 we 
stated that we had begun implementing higher 
selling prices to cover these increased costs. 
Unfortunately this process has taken longer to 
conclude than we had envisaged. This delay will 
have a  3 million impact on operating profit in  
the first quarter of the new financial year. 
These costs have continued to rise since 
negotiations with our customers began, which 
will have a further impact on the outcome for the 
current year. If they continue at present levels and 
are not mitigated by another selling price increase, 
we currently envisage that this could further 
impact on operating profit by up to  2 million  
in the year.
Farm gate milk prices rose significantly during 
2007, with our own milk price rising 7p per 
litre during that period on the back of the 
exceptional boom in commodity prices. Although 
commodities have now fallen from their peak, 
there has been no significant fall in milk prices 
within Great Britain. This has been as a result of 
tight supply caused by significant increases in  
on-farm costs, with therefore little incentive  
for farmers to increase production.
