 RPS Energy confirmed a further reserves upgrade
on both fields for year ended 2008. Gross proved plus
probable reserves on the Bualuang field increased
by a further 7.3 MMbo, which following annual
production, provided a figure of 26.3 MMbo of 2P
reserves for year end 2008. , The 2P reserves estimate
on the Kambuna field increased from 29.2 MMboe
to 33.8 MMboe.
Group 2P reserves as at 31 December 2008 were
67.7 MMboe, 74% increase during 2008 which
represents a 950% reserve replacement ratio for
the year.
Production
A key highlight in 2008 was the Group's production,
which grew 23%, averaging 9,600 boepd. This
comprised 53% liquids and 47% gas. Production
in the first quarter of 2009 has been running at
approximately 11,500 boepd and average daily
production for 2009 is expected to be in the range
of 15,000 to 17,000 boepd. This forecast production
growth will be driven by a first full year contribution
from the Bualuang oil field, a second phase of
Bualuang development drilling, and the start of
production at the Kambuna gas-condensate field
which is expected at the mid-year 2009.
Thailand
Offshore in the Gulf of Thailand, the Group's
operated Bualuang oil field commenced production
on 27 August 2008. Oil is produced into a 500,000 bbl
capacity FPSO, moored adjacent to the wellhead
platform. Over 1.4 million barrels have been
produced to date and the reservoir has so far
performed above expectations.
The pressure data obtained since the field went
into production is strongly indicative of a very active
water drive providing pressure support that has the
potential to improve the recovery factor over and
above previous estimates. Production levels are
forecast to further improve during 2009 through the
drilling of two horizontal wells on the crest of the
structure. These two wells, along with one more
water disposal well, will be drilled and tied in by the
end of May 2009.
2008 was an active year for the Group
on all operating fronts: production grew
as the Bualuang oil field came on stream;
the Kambuna development continued
to progress; and eight seismic surveys were completed
as the exploration and appraisal portfolio continues
to mature.
Health, safety and environment
The addition of the Bualuang production licence and
Glagah-Kambuna TAC to the Group's operated asset
portfolio was a major factor behind an increase to over
three million recordable man hours worked in 2008.
Zero lost time incidents were recorded.
As the level of activity across our operated assets
has increased, the Group has broadened its CSR
programme. The communities it operates within are
important partners to the Group and it is focussed on
providing employment to local people, to increase
awareness of safe working practices and to invest in
projects that bring real benefit to those living in the
areas in which we operate.
Reserves
The Group started 2008 with 38.8 MMboe of
proved and probable (2P) reserves (on a working
interest basis).
In June 2008 RPS Energy, the Group's independent
reserves auditors, completed audits on the Bualuang
and Kambuna fields post completion of development
drilling. As a result of these audits the estimated
2P reserves increased on both fields. Gross proved
and probable reserves on the Bualuang field increased
from 14.9 to 20 MMbo, and proved plus probable
reserves estimated on the Kambuna field increased
from 25.7 MMboe to 29.2 MMboe.

Now we have started to
interpret the results of the
survey it is very rewarding
to see the quality of the data
and the initial leads that are
being identified from it.
Phan Van Trung
Chief Geophysicist
Vietnam
Trung is Salmander's chief
geophysicist in Vietnam and
is based out of the Ho Chi
Minh office. He is responsible
for overseeing all geophysical
studies and operations for
Salamander in Vietnam.
Trung recently contracted,
executed and supervised the
acquisition of two seismic
surveys including the first
OBC, transition zone and land
seismic survey ever completed
in Vietnam.Trung previously
worked with PetroVietnam and
Conoco-Phillips. Within the Bualuang production licence a number
of exploration prospects have been identified with the
potential to add readily accessible reserves to the
Bualuang development project. The Bualuang field
currently produces from the Miocene T4 sands at a
depth of ca. 1,100 metres sub-sea. The T2 and T3
sandstones underlie the main producing reservoir
at depths of circa. 1,350 metres and 1,550 metres sub
sea respectively. In order to explore the potential
of the deeper sands, a pilot hole will be deepened
below the T4 during the drilling of one of the 2009
development wells to investigate the T2 and T3
sandstones within closures developed against the
Bualuang bounding fault. Any observed hydrocarbons
in these sandstones will be logged and sampled
before the pilot hole is plugged back as a producer in
the main T4 reservoir.
Onshore northeast Thailand, production from the
Sinphuhorm gas field averaged 82 MMscfd. During
2008 the Group drilled the South Phu Horm-1
appraisal well to explore the southern extension
of the Sinphuhorm field. The well encountered
significant gas shows within a non-fractured section
of the Pha Nok Khao carbonate reservoir that tested
gas at low flow rates. The Group believes that
Sinphuhorm still has the potential for resources in
excess of the 1 Tcf of 2P reserves currently booked.
Gaining an improved understanding of the fracture
network and dolomitization of the reservoir remains
the key to unlocking the full potential of the field.
To this end, the field operator has budgeted for the
acquisition of a 3D seismic survey in 2009, which
is designed to better image the Pha Nok Khao
carbonate reservoir and so enable future appraisal
and development wells to be optimally located.
In February 2008 the Group announced that
the Dong Mun-3 appraisal well had found gas in
the primary Pha Nok Khao objective and had also
encountered gas in the shallower Jurassic and
Triassic clastic reservoirs. The shallow reservoirs are
prospective in the Phu Kheng structure immediately
updip of Dong Mun-3 which could represent a new
play type in the Khorat Plateau Basin. The Phu Kheng
structure is a laterally extensive feature covering
an area of 125,000 acres with multi-Tcf gas in place
potential. An exploration well is planned in Q2 2009,
which will be located substantially updip of the
Dong Mun-3 well at the level of the Jurassic and
Triassic reservoirs.
Following completion of the Phu Kheng-1 well, the
rig will move to drill the Si That-3 appraisal well in
Block L15/43. This well will appraise a gas bearing
structure analogous in form to the Sinphuhorm
field with the potential to contain up to 1 Tcf of
recoverable reserves.
The Group was awarded the operated
exploration blocks L26/50 and L15/50 in the
Thai 20th licensing round in December 2007 and
January 2008 respectively. These blocks have
expanded the Group's leading acreage position
in the Khorat Plateau Basin. During 2008 the Group
completed a 2D seismic survey in Block L26/50.
The initial interpretation of the data has identified
the presence of four large structures in L26/50
well located to receive charge from the source
kitchen proven in the area.
Block L15/50 contains a gas discovery called Dao
Ruang. A 3D seismic survey is planned for Block
L15/50 designed to help locate appraisal wells in
the optimal positions to encounter good quality
reservoir rock.
Lao PDR
During 2008 the Group added to its position in
Lao PDR through the addition of a 20% interest in the
Champasak & Saravan PSC via a cross assignment
agreement with PetroVietnam Exploration and
Production ( PVEP') whereby PVEP took a 25%
interest in the Group's operated Savannakhet PSC.
The Savannakhet PSC contains two significant gas
prospects each with the potential to contain 1 Tcf of
resources, and an oil prospect with the potential to
contain 150 MMbbls. In 2008 the Group completed a
2D seismic survey over these prospects. This data is
currently being processed and interpreted prior to
drilling in 2010.
Vietnam
During 2008 the Group expanded its position in
Vietnam by agreeing terms for a PSC in Block 31,
offshore Southern Vietnam. The Block 31 PSC, in
which Salamander has a 60% operated interest, was
formally signed and awarded on 10 March 2009. Block
31 contains both syn-rift and basement plays within
the Vin Chau half graben which is analogous in form
and geology to the prolific Cuu Long Basin located to
the east. An extensive 2D seismic survey was acquired
in Q4 2008, prior to the formal signature of the PSC,
to capitalise on good commercial rates offered by
the contractor. The data has been processed and is
currently being interpreted ahead of drilling in 2010.
Operational review continued Development
Salamander is involved in all
areas of hydrocarbon extraction,
from exploration, through drilling
to production and subsequent
field re-development.
I am exposed to all
these areas and my work
straddles many disciplines
including geology, reservoir
engineering, production
engineering and economics.
Such cross discipline
exposure is truly unique
and challenging.
