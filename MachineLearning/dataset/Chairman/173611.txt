Chairman's statement
Introduction
The results for the year to 30 September 2008 show
that revenue has grown by 52% to  27.55m and that
adjusted operating profit has grown by 17% to
 4.07m. These results reflect a full year contribution
from the multi-channel retail businesses acquired in
the previous financial year, together with a strong
trading performance from the manufacturing
business.
The Group continues to see benefits from a business
model that generates approximately 50% of revenue
from annual software licences and support.
Notwithstanding the resilience afforded by this level
of recurring revenue, we continue to seek
opportunities to deliver further improvements to the
business model.
Cash generation has been a major focus of the Group
during the year. Cash generated from operating
activities represented 120% of adjusted operating
profit. Furthermore, the operating structure of the
Group has been reorganised to provide a more tax
efficient arrangement, which will result in a
considerable reduction in the rate of tax paid by the
Group for at least the next three years. The new
operating structure, together with the continued
strong cash generation delivered by the business,
should enable the Group to considerably reduce its
debt levels.
The Group's management structure now includes
an operating board which is made up of the three
executive directors and the managing directors of
the multi-channel retail and manufacturing businesses.
The operating board will meet every month and will
focus both on business development as well
as maximising opportunities within the existing
customer base and the wider multi-channel retail
and manufacturing markets.
Financial results
Group revenue for the year increased by 52% to
 27.55m from  18.17m last year. Adjusted operating
profit rose by 17% to  4.07m from  3.47m achieved
last year. The value of recurring revenues continued
to grow, contributing  13.45m in 2008 (2007:  9.49m).
  These results reflect a full year contribution from the multi-channel retail businesses
acquired in the previous financial year, together with a strong trading performance
from the manufacturing business.
The Group has a resilient business model with approximately half of total revenue derived
from pre-contracted licence and support fees. Sanderson is experiencing continued
growth in sales of online trading solutions and the existing customer base should provide
opportunities to significantly increase cross-selling of its products and services.
Notwithstanding the current challenging economic climate and market conditions in the
retail sector, trading in the current financial year is in line with management's
expectations and five new customers have been acquired in the first quarter.

Profit before taxation has reduced in the year to
 0.90m from  1.94m in 2007. This reduction is due
to an increased amortisation charge in respect of
acquisition-related intangible assets and an increase
in net finance expense as a result of the additional
bank borrowings drawn to fund the previous year's
acquisitions. The profit contribution during the year
from the acquired businesses was earnings enhancing,
more than covering the incremental finance expense
arising from borrowings incurred to fund their
acquisition.
The Group has reported a tax credit of  0.94m in 2008,
compared to a tax charge of  0.59m in 2007. The tax
credit has resulted from a detailed review of the
Group's tax status and in particular unutilised tax losses
brought forward from prior years. Changes to the
treatment of financing inter-group loans and the
ownership of Group intellectual property rights have
enabled tax losses to be utilised. Computations in
respect of the 2006 and 2007 financial years have been
resubmitted and the reduction in tax liabilities thereby
arising is reflected in the credit to the consolidated
income statement reported in 2008. It is envisaged that
remaining losses will continue to be utilised for at least
another three years.
Net debt has been reduced to  10.66m (2007:  11.70m)
with  500,000 of deferred consideration having been
paid during the year. This reduction in debt has been
possible as a result of strong profit to cash conversion
performance. Net debt at the year end represents less
than 2.4 times EBITDA. This has not, in the past, been an
inappropriate ratio for a cash generative business, but
the Board has set a target for net debt to represent
around 2 times EBITDA at 30 September 2009.
Dividend
Since the Group acquired the multi-channel retail
businesses in the previous financial year, there has been a
well-publicised change in the availability of
debt for the financing of commercial transactions.
In addition, the market's attitude towards financial
gearing has changed significantly, especially against the
backdrop of the uncertainty in the general economy.

Chairman's statement continued
The Board has considered very carefully the need
to deliver a progressive dividend whilst planning a
reduction in debt levels. The Board has therefore
decided to adopt a more prudent approach to
financing and to rebase the dividend level in line with
the current share price. Going forward, cash resources
will be focused on reducing the overall level of
Group debt.
Subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting
of Shareholders, expected to be held on 26 February
2009, a final dividend of 0.2 pence per ordinary share is
proposed and will be paid on 27 March 2009 to
shareholders on the register at the close of business on
6 March 2009.
The Group's trading performance in the first quarter
of the new financial year is currently in line with both
management's expectations and last year. Assuming
no further deterioration in the general economy, the
Board intends to adopt a progressive dividend policy,
albeit starting from a lower base and would expect to
deliver an increase on the 1.4 pence that will have been
paid in respect of the financial year ended
30 September 2008.
Business review
Sanderson provides a wide range of software solutions
to the multi-channel retail and manufacturing sectors.
These solutions consist mainly of the Group's own
software together with leading third party products,
which are installed and supported directly by
Sanderson staff.
The Group has a proven business model which
generates a significant proportion of revenue from
annual software licences and support services. These
recurring revenues amounted to  13.45m of revenue
in the year to 30 September 2008, representing 49%
of total revenue (2007:  9.49m, 52% of revenue).
Continuing to build the value of recurring revenues
remains a key Group objective.
New business has increased from 8% to 13% of total
revenue with a number of significant new customers
added during the year.
Review of multi-channel retail business
The Group generated 76% of its revenue from the
multi-channel retail sector. New customers gained
during the year included Fenwick which, when
combined with existing customers such as Harrods,
firmly establishes Sanderson as the leading provider of
point-of-sale solutions to UK department stores.
The Group provides a range of software-based
solutions to key sectors of the retail market, including
enterprise-wide systems for wholesalers and online
trading businesses. This diversification should provide
the Group with a level of protection from the economic
uncertainty affecting UK high street retailers.
During the year we expanded both the range and the
scope of our multi-channel retail product offerings,
which now provide solutions across the multi-channel
retail market. Our initial success in cross-selling these
solutions within our customer base is an encouraging
sign and the growth of this revenue stream is a key
objective for the Group in the new financial year.
Review of manufacturing business
Our manufacturing business accounted for 24%
of revenue in the year to 30 September 2008. Whilst
revenue reduced by 3% to  6.49m, operating profit
in this business increased by 29% to  1.26m as a result
of improved margins, both from delivering our own
software and services, as well as prudent control
of costs.
New customers gained during the year included
Accuracy International and Valley Group, both of
which were won in a competitive marketplace and
provide evidence of the strength of our product
offering. We also achieved further sales of our business
intelligence and data collection solutions. These are
examples of ways in which we are able to provide
existing customers with tools to drive efficiency savings
within their organisations by building on their existing
IT investment.

Strategy
In these challenging times we are acutely aware of the
risk associated with high levels of debt. Sanderson
remains extremely cash generative and our short-term
strategy is to reduce debt levels as quickly as trading
conditions will allow. In the medium term we believe
that the Group is well positioned to benefit from its
exposure to both the retail and manufacturing
markets, as economic conditions improve and
customers make further investment in Sanderson
solutions to drive continual business improvement.
Staff
Sanderson continues to employ staff with high levels
of industry-specific knowledge, who are committed
to delivering quality solutions to our customers.
We would like to thank all our colleagues for their
continued dedication in working with customers
and business partners.
Outlook
The Group has a resilient business model with
approximately half of total revenue derived from
pre-contracted licence and support fees. Sanderson
is experiencing continued growth in sales of online
trading solutions and the existing customer base
should provide opportunities to significantly increase
cross-selling of its products and services.
Notwithstanding the current challenging economic
climate and market conditions in the retail sector,
trading in the current financial year is in line with
management's expectations and five new customers
have been acquired in the first quarter.
