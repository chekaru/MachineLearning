we	have	demonstrated	our	ability	to	react

dividend
The	Board	is	pleased	to	recommend	a	fi 	 nal	
dividend	of	2.67p	per	share,	making	the	total	
dividend	for	the	year	4.0p	(2008:	3.6p),	an	
increase	of	11	per	cent.	W e	are	pleased	that

the	signifi 	 cant	change	in	market	conditions.	
It	remains	our	intention	to	have	a	progressive	
dividend	policy	balancing	growth	in	earnings

employees
At	the	end	of	April	2009	we	had	6,406	staff ,	
a	broadly	similar	number	to	the 	figure	at	the	
end	of	April	2008.	This	has	been	a	difficult	year	
for	our	staff	with	the	uncertainties	in	some	of	
our	Sectors.	W e	are	grateful	for	the	flexibility	
that	they	have	shown	in	helping	us	to	adjust	
to	the	changing	requirements	of	our	markets.
our	continuing	challenge	is	to	provide	our	
staff	with	the	opportunity	to	demonstrate	their	
ambition,	passion	for	their	work,	collaboration	
and	knowledge.	our	staff	remain	critical	to	our	
reputation,	our	continuing	innovation	and	our	
ability	to	respond	to	changing	circumstances.
on	behalf	of	the	Board	I	would	like	to	thank	
all	our	members	of 	 staff	for	their	outstanding	
contributions	to	Scott	W ilson	over	the	last	year .
