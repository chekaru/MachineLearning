  
Chairman's statement 
__________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Introduction 
This year we have seen the breakthrough into the independent servicer marketplace with our Fulcrum  
solution. We see this new opportunity as being so significant we have set up a new dedicated business unit, 
Field Service Solutions to fully exploit the market potential.  
  
Since 30th December we have signed two new transaction-based contracts and a Memorandum of 
Understanding, acquired the business assets of Keyprestige, and raised  5.9 million (net of costs) additional 
working capital. This will provide sufficient investment to allow the company to become the leader in managing 
and controlling the work of independent servicers on behalf of large corporate job providers. 
  
We continue to be regarded as the solution of choice for larger corporate buyers of scheduling solutions, but 
they are demanding return on investment (RoI) be proven before deployment. This increases the length of the 
sales cycle as they require a proof of concept  and initial pilot  before moving to enterprise deployment. 
However it provides us with good visibility and high confidence about the predictability of future revenues and 
cash flow. 
 
It is disappointing to report revenue for 2003 falling to  2,638k representing a reduction of  1,845k as compared 
to 2002. This reflects the impact of the move away from large enterprise licence purchases to phased payment 
for rollout projects. The three new transaction-based pricing contracts did not contribute revenue in 2003. The 
gross margin has also fallen from 75% to 58% reflecting the reduction in the proportion of software licence 
sales. 
 
We submitted an unprecedented number of proposals for SERVICEPower during 2003, indicating the market is 
moving from a technology-push to a consumer-pull market. We have won seven new SERVICEPower deals in 
2003 plus the GEC&I Field Service Solutions contract. This is the highest number of contracts we have signed 
in a single year. In the last three months of 2003 we won three new proof of concept contracts, all with Fortune 
100 companies which we expect to deliver revenue in 2004.  
 
The directors have confidence in the continued revenue growth of the business. 
Results and Dividend 
The loss before taxation was  1,624k (2002: loss of  555k). The operating cost is  3,157k,  866k less than in 
2002, reflecting the continued close control of costs. The loss per share for the period was 2.67p (2002: loss per 
share of 0.64p). The Directors do not recommend the payment of a dividend. 
 
SERVICEPower Business Review  
 
I reported in the Interim Results the company had tendered for an unprecedented number of contracts for 
SERVICEPower scheduling products. I am pleased to report this high level of activity has continued into the 
second half of the year with seven new contracts won in 2003; three of which are proof of concept contracts 
with Fortune 100 companies.  
 
The field service industry continues to move away from enterprise software licence purchase to phased 
implementations involving proof of concept, pilot and rollout phases. This change has had a significant impact 
on our 2003 full year revenue as it defers revenue into future years. In addition, the long sales cycle continues to 
make timing of contract awards uncertain leading to expected 2003 revenues being delayed until 2004. In view 
of our success in turning proof of concepts into successful rollouts, the directors are very confident these 
projects will make a significant contribution to future revenues. In addition, existing customers continue to place 
additional business with us.

__________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
The deferral of revenue has meant the directors have been required to continue to carefully control costs. Staff 
costs, directors emoluments and administration costs have been reduced by  866,000. The directors believe the 
SERVICEPower base costs are now in line with revenue. 
 
Technology and Products 
 
ServicePower is renowned for the breadth and quality of its product functionality and the directors are 
determined this will remain so. Our Version 5 SERVICEPower product is now live at 14 customer sites. In 2003 
we continued to develop the SERVICE/Planner product and released our new SERVICE/Mobility product. 
SERVICE/Mobility is a state-of-the-art application that allows field service technicians to receive information 
about their jobs and report progress back to their headquarters in real time. We recently announced this will be 
further enhanced by our partner Konaware, Inc. to extend the functionality of our Field Service Solutions 
offering.  
 
It is our aim to focus our very experienced in-house development team on the development of strategic 
scheduling functionality and outsource the development of ancillary product functionality whenever possible. 
The development of the Fulcrum system has been contracted to an Indian company, TATA, who were involved 
in the development of GEC&I's electronic despatch system. 
 
Partnership Agreements 
 
In addition to software partners, the company is developing partnerships with companies that will sell, install 
and support the product in new markets and in particular to non-English speaking countries. We are currently 
working on several sales campaigns with PDSC and Astea in the US, and with Square in Europe. In March 2003 
we signed an agreement with Productility to distribute SERVICEPower in Italy and in February 2004 we 
announced Greenbaum Associates AG will distribute and support the SERVICEPower intelligent scheduler 
throughout German speaking countries. We look forward to these arrangements delivering a new revenue stream 
in 2004.  
 
Field Service Solutions Business Plan 
 
Over the last two years the company has invested much time in research to gain a sound understanding of how 
jobs are carried out by independent service organisations in the US. The Directors concluded that this is a large 
and growing segment, that there is a similar marketplace in Europe, neither of which are serviced by any of the 
traditional field service solution vendors. ServicePower, by being the first to market with a solution has a 
opportunity to dominate the market. The Directors also concluded that to be successful in this huge but 
fragmented market the Company should focus on one sector, gain control of the jobs, develop a software 
solution and get access to the independent servicers. This would mean a substantial change to our current 
business model. The Company will become an outsourced solution provider in addition to being a software 
vendor.  
 
In recent months we have made great progress towards implementing this new business model. We have access 
to jobs through the contract with GEC&I announced in January. This contract also gives us exclusive rights to 
exploit the GEC&I patent-pending technology. It is GEC&I's intention that this software should become the 
industry-standard method of controlling jobs and are actively promoting its adoption by hosting industry 
strategy briefings with leading manufacturers and retailers. The recent acquisition of the business assets of 
Keyprestige Inc. gives us the rights to the  ClaimWorks' application which alongside GEC&I's application and 
the SERVICEPower suite of software provides a comprehensive and unique solution to the appliance and 
consumer electronics market's needs. The long-term plan is to use the solution as a base offering upon which to 
build additional higher value services for the appliance and consumer electronics market and then to expand the 
business into other markets and geographies.

 3 __________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
We have augmented our management team to ensure the success of this new business by recruiting Chris Smith, 
previously President of GEC&I Warranty Management. Chris, who has a wide range of experience in the 
retailer and appliance sectors, will head Field Service Solutions. He has already started recruiting an experienced 
team into our new offices in Louisville Kentucky, to sell the concept to other manufacturers and retailers, and 
along with the founders of Keyprestige to manage the ongoing operations.  
 
I am now pleased to say the contract announced on February 20th is with Whirlpool Corporation. Whirlpool are 
the largest appliance manufacturer in the US and the award of this contract confirms that our offering is capable 
of providing an industry-wide solution. We are confident the major appliance and consumer electronics 
businesses are ready to outsource their work to a company with an application capable of consolidating the 
market and providing improved customer service, whilst at the same time driving down costs to all involved in 
the service chain.     
 
Contractual negotiations are proceeding well to convert the Memorandum of Understanding with US Digital 
Television Inc. (USDTV) into a full Agreement. This contract is potentially the largest in the history of the 
company. We intend to use the infrastructure developed for the appliance market to provide a unique scheduling 
and installation management service for this new business opportunity. All United States over-the-air broadcast 
television stations are being converted to the new digital format. More than 10 million homes must change and 
USDTV management expects at least 2 million will eventually select its offering.  
The first two contracts are already delivering revenue and we would expect to start managing installations for 
USDTV in April. In total these contracts are expected to deliver at least  2.7m revenue in 2004. 
 
Outlook 
 
The Directors believe the new commercial model for the independent service marketplace is the right direction 
for the company to take. It has been confirmed by signing three agreements in as many months, two of which 
are the largest in the company history. The  5.9 million new cash gives us sufficient funds to establish a 
dominant position in this market and the regular revenue and cash from long-term contracts will underpin the 
future success of the company. The SERVICEPower software business is well established and set for growth. 
Accordingly the Board is very confident for the future of the company.
