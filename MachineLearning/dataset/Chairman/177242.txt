Introduction
ServicePower has made good progress throughout the year, exceeding market forecasts for 2011 and importantly
delivering a good level of profits.We were delighted to welcome some prestigious organisations onto our client roster,
including the RSPCA and Assurant, which not only underlines the power of our technology offering but also the
breadth of its appeal.
We continue to focus on the delivery of high margin software, hosting and Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings, the
success of which has been evidenced by the increase in licence and royalty revenue during the year. This has the
benefit of lowering the risk of the business by enhancing profit margins and providing for more scalability. ServicePower
now has a growing base of profitable contracts providing a strong platform for future growth.
Our ability to offer our customers flexibility in terms of software delivery model, selling either via a licence or as a
hosted service, continues to be well received by customers. In addition, several of the contracts won during the year
were secured following rigorous competitive testing, proving the stability and highly scalable nature of our software
platform.
This success has been achieved despite the relatively challenging market conditions continuing.While our offerings help
businesses deliver additional services to customers and maximise the efficiency of field services, those businesses are
still facing budget constraints, and we therefore continue to view our sales pipeline favourably, but nevertheless,
conservatively.
The Board is firmly focused on generating increased organic profits but continues to consider the potential for
accelerated growth through very selective acquisitions. ServicePower will also seek to grow through the entry into new
market sectors and further extensions of contracts with existing customers.
Financial Review
The Company has two segments, ServiceScheduling and ServiceOperations.
Due to the decision taken in previous years to refocus the business away from low-margin ServiceOperations
contracts, the decrease in revenues for the year has resulted in a significant increase in profit margins.
T otal revenue for the year decreased by 27 per cent. T o  13.3 million (2010:  18.3 million).Within this,
ServiceOperations revenue reduced by 51 per cent. T o  5.6 million (2010:  11.5 million) due in particular to the
removal of low margin business in the UK in the second half of the prior year, whilst ServiceScheduling licence and
consultancy revenue increased by 13 per cent. T o  7.7 million (2010:  6.8 million).
A breakdown of revenue from the ServiceScheduling segment is as follows:
2011 2010
  million   million
Licences 2.1 1.6
Implementation/support 5.1 4.8
Mobility 0.5 0.4
T otal 7.7 6.8

A breakdown of revenue from the ServiceOperations segment is as follows:

Implementation/support 0.8  
Hosting/SaaS 1.2 1.9
Operations US 1.3 3.0
Operations UK 1.4 6.6
T otal 5.6 11.5
The Company continued to invest in maintaining of functionalities across all of its product range, investing  0.7 million
in 2011 (2010:  0.8 million).
Gross profit for the period increased to  6.7 million (2010:  5.1 million) due to the change in product mix as shown in
the table above, and profit before tax increased to  1.1 million (2010:  0.6 million).
The adjusted profit before tax was  0.9 million, an improvement of  0.6 million on the adjusted profit of  0.3 million in
2010. The adjusted profit before tax refers to the profit before tax adjusted for a foreign exchange translation gain of
 0.2 million (2010:  0.3 million).
The basic and diluted earnings per share for the full year was 0.50p (2010: basic and diluted earnings per share of
0.30p).
Cash balances were  5.5 million at 31 December 2011, compared to the cash balances at 31 December 2010 of  3.7
million.
The directors cannot recommend the payment of a dividend at this time (2010: same).
Operational Review
Customers
The healthy pipeline with which the Group entered the year delivered several significant new customer wins.
ServiceScheduling
In December 2011, the ServiceScheduling platform was selected by the RSPCA, the UK's leading animal welfare charity,
as part of its new Command and Control Project. The contract is for an initial five years, consisting of a licences,
maintenance and support.
The RSPCA has a vital role to play in crisis situations that threaten the welfare of animals. ServicePower's
ServiceScheduling platform will be used by the RSPCA to improve the management of its officers' workloads. The
platform will enable the scheduling and dispatch of incidents in real time to officers out in the field and the subsequent
management of the ongoing actions associated with each incident.
Steritech, one of the largest outsourced food safety and quality assurance companies in the US also became a new
customer for ServiceScheduling, while existing ServiceScheduling customers, including Homeserve, and North
America's leading home appliance retailer and largest provider of home services, extended their use of the software. Report and Financial Statements 31 December 2011

ServiceOperations
In addition to extending its ServiceScheduling licence, Homeserve added a new two year contract for the
ServiceOperations SaaS platform to manage the dispatch of jobs and the payment of claims.
Another existing customer, Richer Sounds, the UK's hi-fi, home cinema and flat panelTV specialist retailer, also extended
its use of the platform, moving from a rolling one year contract onto a three year contract, adding a number of new
home services. ServicePower is now also providing access to, and managing, a network of qualified servicers across the
UK who will deliver a UK home repair service to Richer Sounds' customers, providing a physical repair, installation and
inspection network service.
Following a successful development and implementation phase, ServicePower's ServiceOperations software also went
live in the period at Mitsubishi, managing the claims and dispatch for the repair of consumer electronics across North
America and replacing an incumbent provider.
The most significant contract in the year was the signing of an additional ServiceOperations licence and revenue share
contract in March 2011 with Assurant Solutions, one of the world's leading speciality insurance providers. Assurant has
used ServiceOperations software via the SaaS model for over five years. The new arrangement will expand the use of
the software for the management of claims and dispatch. ServicePower will receive licence revenue, software
development and maintenance fees throughout the term of the contract.
In addition,Assurant Solutions will provide access to the ServiceOperations software to its commercial customer base,
which includes some of the world's leading retailers and manufacturers.
ServicePower was delighted to announce in June the first customer to be added via this partnership, a tier 1 retailer.
The contract is worth a minimum of  1.5 million in revenue in 2011 and due to the part transactional nature of the
implementation, has the ability to grow in 2012 and 2013.
Assurant continues to actively target many additional top retailers in the US and ServicePower hopes to be able to
update shareholders on further progress in 2012.
Market developments
In the current market environment, service and retail organisations are seeking means of increasing their customer
offerings while also increasing efficiencies within their organisations.What has been evident in 2011 is the growing
adoption of scheduling technology across a broad sweep of sectors to enable what have previously been complex
scheduling processes carried out manually to become automated and therefore more efficient. Both our
ServiceScheduling and ServiceOperations platforms can demonstrate high levels of return on investment and are
therefore well placed to benefit from this trend.
In addition, in the current economic climate, retailers in particular are seeing slow growth in store revenues and are
seeking new means of revenue generation. There is a growing recognition of the value of service offerings, such as
installation and warranty, alongside traditional product ranges. In 2012 we will continue to address this part of the
market through our ServiceScheduling and ServiceOperations platforms but also via the ServiceMarket platform,
described below. 5
Products
We continued to invest in enhancements to our core ServiceScheduling and ServiceOperations products including a
major new release of ServiceScheduling in January 2012. This added support for new platforms and operating systems,
enabling the management of staff capacity at a more granular level and improvement of the handling of non-working
time, such as breaks. Further integration between ServiceScheduling and ServiceOperations has been developed with
the introduction of ServiceBroker which allows clients to direct work between various channels of employed engineers,
the independent servicer network or ServiceMarket.
During 2012, further development will continue to support the next generation of ServicePower products using cloud
technology.
ServiceMarket
During the latter part of 2011 ServicePower added ServiceMarket to its portfolio of software products. ServiceMarket
is a web-based marketplace on which pre-approved servicers can  bid' for service jobs advertised by retailers,
incorporating a payment system. ServicePower will market the software platform initially to the US retail market. The
directors anticipate this will form part of the ServiceOperations segment.
Growth Strategy
ServicePower is the only independent global provider in the marketplace and our market position and expertise is
becoming more widely known.We are a leader in the white goods, consumer electronics, and insurance and energy
verticals and continue to build on our reputation in these sectors. However, we are now actively seeking additional
opportunities in other market verticals such as retail and home services, both of which provide significant
opportunities for 2012.
Outlook
We continue to be focused on our main markets of the US and UK and are working on a number of scheduling
opportunities and transactional business opportunities both directly and through Assurant.With a robust and scalable
software platform, a growing customer base and strengthened financial position we believe the opportunities for
ServicePower to be highly encouraging and are confident of a successful outcome to the year.
