review of The perioD
The Group delivered another year of continued growth, reporting 
sales up 9% to  76.9 million (2007:  70.5 million) with profit before 
tax and earnings per share growing by 4%. The business benefitted 
from increasing coal prices and achieved growth in profitability 
despite a reduction in volumes arising from a planning delay to 
the Grievehill site and record oil prices leading to an increase in 
operating costs. Operating cash flow remained a strong feature 
of the Group's results at  22.6 million (2007:  23.6 million).
opera Tional review
surface Mining Profit before interest and tax grew by around a quarter during 
the year to  9.8 million (2007:  7.9 million). The new mine at 
Muir Dean and the extension to the Grievehill site were opened 
successfully in the second half of the year and, with a full year 
contribution from these sites, overall production volumes are 
expected to increase by more than 10% in 2009.
During the year, new planning consents were received for the 
Muir Dean (2.2 million tonnes) and Grievehill (1.0 million tonnes) 
sites. Local planning consent was received for two extensions to the 
Glenmuckloch mine (0.7 million tonnes) and a new mine at Rigg 
(1.1 million tonnes) in Dumfries and Galloway with full approval 
received after the period end. Following the year end, a planning 
application for 0.6 million tonnes was submitted for a further 
extension to the Skares Road mine and a 0.4 million tonne 
extension to another mine was added to probable reserves. During 
2009, the Group expects to submit at least two further planning 
applications for an additional 3 million tonnes of reserves.
regenera Tion Profit before interest and tax was  3.2 million (2007:  4.5 million) 
reflecting the completion, as planned, of coal production at the 
Grimethorpe site in July 2008 when the site entered into a short 
period of restoration.

increasing A
Group revenue increased by 9% to  76.9 million 
(2007:  70.5 million) after benefiting from increasing 
coal prices. Operating cash flow at  22.6 million 
(2007:  23.6 million) remains a key feature of the 
Group's performance.
Tip washing opportunities in Australia are a high growth 
opportunity for the Group given the scale of the coal 
mining industry and the estimated volume of coal 
rejects on the surface.
Market prices for non-contracted coal are  15 higher 
than current contracts.

Operations at Grimethorpe have been extremely successful 
and returns from this project alone have more than justified the 
original purchase price of the business. The technology is unique 
to ATH Resources and patents to protect the Group's intellectual 
property rights internationally are pending.
A number of new tip washing opportunities have been developed 
in the UK during the year where the estimated coal content is 
in excess of 2 million tonnes. The first of these, at Langton in 
Nottinghamshire, is expected to commence operations in the 
first half of 2009. 
Interest in the deployment of the Group's technology in Australia 
has increased during the year. The Group is preferred bidder on a 
project to wash 11 million tonnes of coal rejects at an operational 
mine in Queensland. Although this project has not moved forward 
as quickly as initially expected, the potential client appears 
committed to an ATH Regeneration plant and is also reviewing 
strategic options for wider deployment on a number of other mines. 
In addition, the Group has, under contract, sampled and analysed 
tips for another party in Queensland and is currently in negotiation 
for a three to five year tip washing project, to commence in 2009.
Tip washing projects in Australia are a major opportunity for growth 
of the business given the number, sizes and coal content of rejects 
tips, especially in Queensland, where the State Government has 
indicated in excess of 200 million tonnes of rejects on the surface 
which could be suitable for processing.
reserves The Group has a dual strategy of growing coal reserves organically 
from its existing portfolio of sites and making suitable complementary 
acquisitions. Estimated reserves of recoverable coal were 8.2 million 
tonnes (2007: 8.6 million tonnes) at the year end. Current planning 
activity levels are expected to replace coal produced with new 
reserves securing production for the foreseeable future.

MarkeT
Demand for coal in the UK was largely unchanged at around 
60 million tonnes during 2008 with indigenous coal production 
meeting approximately one third of total usage.
International coal prices during the year rose to an unprecedented 
level, peaking at over $220 per tonne, in line with the increase in oil 
prices. Prices have fallen since the summer and returned to below 
the $100 per tonne level. Although this is less than half of the price 
at its peak, the price remains higher than twelve months ago and, 
assisted by the strength of the US dollar, is approximately  15 per 
tonne higher than the average selling price in 2008.
The Group holds agreements at September 2008 with a number 
of major UK electricity generators covering the supply of 3.6 million 
tonnes of coal up to 2012. These agreements were negotiated 
at a time of lower coal prices and are at an average of around 
 32 per tonne. 
heal Th anD safeTy The Board understands the potentially hazardous nature of the 
work undertaken in the Group's operations and takes very seriously 
its responsibilities for health and safety.
Operational sites have a nominated and qualified health and 
safety manager and employees are regularly trained in the Group's 
processes which are aimed to exceed HSE best practice. In order to 
further strengthen the Group's capability, a dedicated HSE manager 
has been recruited during the year to oversee the creation and 
adoption of best practice policies and procedures and to further 
strengthen the Group's commitment to continuous improvement 
in health and safety performance.

with many years' experience of operating mines and reclamation projects in coalfield areas, ATH has successfully returned 
operational or derelict land to beneficial new uses connected to leisure, agriculture, forestry, nature conservation and a variety 
of employment related purposes. With the Grimethorpe project in Yorkshire in its final phases, ATH is expecting to commence 
the reclamation of its Langton property in Nottinghamshire.
