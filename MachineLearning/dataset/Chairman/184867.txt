   At the start

were pleased 
to announce 
the strategic

 	 	 The	financial

resilient	business	
performance	in	
the	face	of	the	
difficult	trading	
and economic 
conditions	faced	
by	Sportech	
 	 	 Ove r	the	past	
four	years,	net	
debt	has	reduced	
by	 28.2m	(26%)
 	 	 Sportech	entered	
into an amendment

has	incurred	a	loss	before	tax	for	the	financial 	year	
of	 17.0m	(2008:	profit	of	 7.1m).	Due	to	this	loss,	
the	Group	has	a	taxation	credit	of	 4.7m	in	the	year	
(2008:	tax	charge	of	 2.0m).	Retained	losses	and	
loss	per	share	for	the	year	amounted	to	 12.3m

On	31	December	2009,	Sportech	entered	into	an

ongoing	basis.	The	revised	facilities,	which	amount	
to	 90.75m,	give	the	Group	the	flexibility	it	requires	
to	develop	organically	as	well	as	providing	it	with

business 	 development 	 opportunities. 	 These	
facilities 	 have 	 subsequently 	 been 	 amended	
to 	 accommodate 	 the 	 acquisition 	 of 	 SGR.
dIvIdeNd
As	in	previous	years,	no	dividend	is	proposed	
as	the	Board	believes	that	it	must	continue 	to	
reduce	debt	as	well	as	undertake	selective	
investment	in	growth	opportunities.
vA t CLAIms
The	Board	announced	on	1	April	2009	that	the	
G r o u p 	 h a d 	 s u b m i t t e d 	 a 	 c l a i m 	 f o r 	 i n 	 e x c e s s 	 o f

for 	 the 	 repayment 	 of 	 VA T 	 overpaid 	 in 	 respect 	 of	
the	 Spot	the	Ball'	game	from	1979	to	1996.	Interest	
may 	 also 	 be 	 added 	 to 	 the 	 principal 	 sum 	 claimed,

give 	 no 	 guarantees 	 as 	 to 	 the 	 successful 	 outcome	
of 	 this 	 claim, 	 and 	 has 	 been 	 advised 	 that 	 it 	 may

The 	 Group's 	 advisers 	 remain 	 in 	 dialogue 	 with
