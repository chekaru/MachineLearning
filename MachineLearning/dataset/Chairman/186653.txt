 We have delivered record sales and post tax
profits for 2002 in continuing tough trading
conditions for IT companies. Encouragingly,
we have achieved growth for the last three
quarters also, at a time when many software
companies have reported a major decline in
their core software licence revenue. We are
also pleased to announce that the Group
returned to profitability during 2002.
Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation
and Amortisation (EBITDA) is  4.0 million
for 2002, which compares to an EBITDA
loss of  1.9 million for 2001.

We have been successful in keeping costs under tight control with the full
year benefit of actions taken in 2001 resulting in overall costs being 12%
down on 2001 and principally reflecting a lower average headcount of
339 people in the year (13% less than 2001).
Revenue 
Overcoming the slow start, total sales increased for the year and finished
the year strongly. We achieved record revenue in the fourth quarter of
 12.7 million, representing a 14% increase on the fourth quarter 2001 of
 1.5 million. The UK/SEEMA division led with a number of noteworthy
deals in the period, backed up by solid performances from most other
business units, especially in the Netherlands, Spain and the USA. Licence
sales surged to  8.3 million, 65% of total sales in the quarter. 
Overall, 65% of sales were overseas (2001: 70%). Staffware licence sales
accounted for a healthy 55% of total sales in the year (2001: 56%). The
Staffware Process Suite led our thrust into the Business Process
Management BPM market, and represented 34% of licence revenue in
the year.
There was an increase of 27% in the average order value for licences, to
 94,000, compared to  74,000 last year, offsetting the lower number of
343 licence deals, compared to the 413 in 2001. Encouragingly, the 
proportion of sales to existing customers, extending their use of Staffware
also increased to 68% (2001:50%). I believe this is a positive reflection of
the return our customers are achieving from their investment in Staffware
technology, in terms of improved productivity, better customer service and
heightened control.
Maintenance support revenue increased to  9.1 million, a 16% increase
on 2001. Deferred income increased 47% to  8.1 million (2001:  5.5
million), all of which will be realised as revenue during 2003.
Professional services revenue, covering on-site technical consulting and
training fees was down by 9% for the year at  8.3 million (2001:  9.1
million) due to a combination of timing of the software revenue, the
deliberate shortening of implementation timescales and the successful
skills transfer to both partners and customers.
In 2002 we signed 22 (2001: 19)  250,000 plus contracts. These
included:-
UK - A number of contracts in the government sector
including DVLA, Companies House and the
Environment Agency, as well as the Insurance and
Investment Division of HBOS. 
Germany - Deutsche BKK, a public health insurance company 
seeking to optimise their core business processes for
1,500 employees with Staffware.

Cap Gemini Ernst & Young, EDS and Deloitte and Touche, accounted for
40% of total sales in 2002 (2001: 28%), including noteworthy contracts
in the UK and Hong Kong. In addition, another 20% of revenue came in
association with Partners.

Working Capital 
The Group has an extremely strong balance sheet and is importantly very
well capitalised. Cash collections continued at a high level and as at 31
December 2002 cash resources were up by  1.7 million to  19.0 million
(2001:  17 .3 million). The Group had no indebtedness other than standard
equipment/vehicle leasing arrangements. Trade debtors stood at  12.3
million at 31 December 2002 (2001:  8.6 million) representing
approximately 61 days of sales (2001: 45 days). There were record
receipts in January 2003 of  8.1 million.
Product Development 
During the year, we invested  7.1 million in Research and Development
(2001:  7 .5 million), representing 18.1% of sales. This compares to the UK
and global software industry averages of 5.8% and 10.2% respectively.

Following the release in late 2001 of Version 1 of the Staffware Process
Suite, this year we have been developing the new functionality of Version 2,
a number of components of which were delivered during the course of the
year to selected customers and partners, once again on time and under
budget. These combined new features further strengthen our appeal to IT
professionals designing, integrating, deploying medium to high volume
mission-critical process centric applications in complex environments. The
Staffware Process Suite has proven its capability to enhance customers'
investments in IT, such as Enterprise Software, by streamlining
interconnecting transactions, as the  Independent Process Layer'. 
Dividend 
The Board of Directors recommends that a final dividend for 2002 of 4.0p
per ordinary share, be paid on 14 April 2003 to shareholders on the
register at the close of business on 21 March 2003, subject to approval at
the AGM on 11 April 2003. This makes a total of 5.0p for the year and
marks a step change compared with a total of 1.0p for the year 2001,
recognising the improvement in our performance in 2002. 
Staff 
Our management and staff rose to the challenge magnificently in 2002
by helping us achieve a great turnaround in profits without sacrificing sales
revenue in the process. A 17% improvement in our productivity, in terms of
revenue per head, reflects the combined results of their skills, experience
and commitment. I am confident they can be relied upon to continue to
perform at world-class levels, for which the board is truly appreciative. 
Outlook 
Notwithstanding the current downbeat tone of most commentators on the
IT industry, we do believe Staffware has carved out a unique position,
which positions it well. Our dedication has been the essence of our
success. This dedication is exemplified by a continued high investment in
R&D, in both good and not so good times, allied to unwavering
management focus, historically on workflow and in the last 18 months on
its expansion as BPM.
During last year our technology has been acclaimed as world leading by
independent analysts such as Doculabs and Yphise. It was gratifying to
note that the Aberdeen Group identified Staffware as the number one
BPM dedicated specialist in the world in its September 2002 survey,
despite the current debate about the definition of BPM and the inclusion
of 36 claimed vendors - both public and private, specialist or otherwise.
Such confusion about BPM, commonplace in emerging technology
markets, signals a real opportunity for Staffware to be a dominant player in
one of the few global IT markets forecast to grow faster than GDP growth.
The planned launch of Version 2 of the Staffware Process Suite in April of
this year should strengthen our market and technology leadership in BPM.
We plan to re-double our efforts in the area of Process Frameworks,
specifically targeted at the financial services and telecoms markets. In
addition, we are launching revitalised Customer and Partner programmes,
plus continuing to pay significant management attention to investing in our
staff to build on the improvement in productivity last year.
Our marketing is being targeted at creating a higher profile with both the
business and technology community interested in attaining the benefits
being achieved by our customers and partners around the world - at a time
when there remains deep scepticism about the claims being made by
many other software companies. In other words, Staffware is now being
seen as a  must have' rather than just a  nice to have' technology by more
and more organisations in business and government.
Underlying all of the above will be the continued tight management of
costs and cash, which has especially stood us in good stead in the recent
past, and we look forward to making continued progress during 2003. Staffware plc Annual Report and Accounts 2002  End-to-End Processes Connecting Islands of Technology
