 I am very pleased to report that 2003 sales, profits and cash all reached record levels,
surpassing our record achievements in 2002. Our results for 2003 are particularly pleasing
given that trading conditions for IT companies generally have continued to be challenging. Sales
revenue increased by 9% to  42.7 million, compared with  39.0 million in 2002. Earnings
Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) increased 20% to  4.8 million for
2003, compared with  4.0 million for 2002. Cash balances improved by  2.8 million, 15%, to
 21.8 million over the course of the year.
It is just over 10 years since we changed our company name to Staffware. Staffware has since this time achieved 38% p.a. average compound
sales growth, having increased sales approximately 25 fold in that timeframe. During the same period, we have increased earnings per share
pre goodwill 13 fold from 1.7p to 22.7p in 2003. I believe these are all noteworthy achievements for Staffware in the fast moving and volatile
software industry.

Revenue
The record revenue came as a result of solid performance in the fourth
quarter of  13.4 million sales, representing a 5% increase of  0.7 million on
the fourth quarter 2002 (2002:  12.7 million).
For the year, licence sales were driven by the strong growth of licence sales
of our Business Process Management flagship product, the iProcess Engine,
which increased 128% over 2002 to  16.4 million (2002:  7.2 million). The
success of the iProcess Engine now means that it accounts for 75% of our
total licence revenue, compared with 33% in 2002. Overall licence sales
were  21.9 million, a marginal increase compared with  21.6 million in
2002, representing 51% of total sales, compared with 55% in 2002. 
There was a 41% increase in our Maintenance Support revenue to  12.8
million (2002:  9.1 million), which is a strong indicator of the continued
loyalty of our growing customer base of 677 organisations on support
contracts, up from 661 the previous year. Our high rate of support contract
renewals resulted in annualised support revenue at the end of 2003 of
 13.7 million, an increase of 37% compared with  10.0 million at the end
of 2002.
Profitability improved in our Professional Services businesses which
comprise on-site design and integration services, plus training. Whilst there
was an overall decrease in sales revenue of 6% to  7.8 million compared
with 2002 ( 8.3 million), profits increased by 25% to  1.0 million. This was
the result of the continued policy of shortening implementation timescales
and the successful transfer of Staffware skills to both partners and
customers. Overall, more than 200 projects were completed successfully in
the year, underlining Staffware's valuable expertise in the deployment of
BPM/Workflow technology, globally. These included high profile projects in
Asia for the Hong Kong Immigration Department, ADP Brokerage Services
in the USA and the Royal Bank of Scotland in the UK. 
Our licence average order value, improved by 10% to  103,000, compared
with  94,000 last year. The proportion of sales to existing customers
extending their use of Staffware technology was 70%, which compares with
68% in 2002 and 50% in 2001, again signifying our customers' satisfaction
with our product and services. 
Deferred income increased 19% to  9.6 million (2002:  8.1 million), all of
which will be realisable as revenue during 2004. This includes  0.4 million
licence revenue.
In 2003, we signed 9 (2002: 7)  500,000 plus contracts. These included
the Royal Bank of Scotland, Global Home Loans and a Government
department in the UK; ABN AMRO and KPN in Holland; a large Telco in
Poland; Mutual & Federal in South Africa; and ABN AMRO and a global
financial services company in the US.

Geographical Distribution
For the year overall, by region, the UK/SEEMA division led with major
deals in the UK and Poland; in Germany, our business enjoyed a
remarkable turnaround from 2002 and there were noteworthy improved
performances also in Australia, the Nordic region, Spain and South Africa.
Staffware in the Netherlands continued to be very profitable, despite
some deals slipping into 2004. Our businesses in Asia and France did
not achieve expectations but we do anticipate improved results in 2004.
Our Americas division achieved its second profitable year in succession
with $9.8 million of sales in 2003 (2002: $7.8 million) representing 26%
growth. Our progress here provides the Company with a solid platform for
continued organic growth and the potential for future acquisitions.
Flagship customers there include ABN AMRO, UnumProvident and ADP
Brokerage Services. 
Overall, 70% of sales were outside of the UK, evidence of the
increasingly international nature of our business (2002: 65%). Sales by
destination in pounds sterling terms were as follows:
% 2003 2002
UK 30 35
Rest of Europe 37 32
Americas 14 13
Australia 7 11
Asia Pacific 4 5

Vertical Market Distribution
The Financial Services Industries - Retail/Wholesale Banking and Insurance
- again pre-dominated, reflecting our ability to leverage our excellent
reputation in these markets. Telecommunications was also a strong market,
driven by our focus on applications to help improve internal efficiencies with
high ROIs. The Government sector remains a target for Staffware in the
short and medium term as both central and local governments around the
world invest to streamline their organisation and improve services to their
citizens. Overall, the main markets were:

Working Capital
Cash collections reached a record of  46.6 million in 2003 (2002:  39.6
million). At 31 December 2003, cash resources had increased by  2.8
million, an increase of 15% to  21.8 million (2002:  19.0 million). The
Group had no material indebtedness. Trade debtors stood at  12.2 million at
31 December 2003 (2002:  12.3 million) representing approximately 54
days of sales (2002: 61 days) as we have continued to focus on working
capital management. 
Product Development
During the year, we continued to focus significant investment in R&D, an
increase of 6% to  7.5 million (2002:  7.1 million), representing 18% of
sales (2002: 18%). This compares with the UK and global software industry
averages of 7% and 11% respectively (source: The 2003 R&D Scoreboard;
Department of Trade and Industry). Since our IPO seven years ago, we have
invested an average of 18% of our sales in Product Development, amounting
to  40 million, which we believe is a major factor in maintaining our
leadership as a best of breed BPM provider internationally.
Version 2 of the Staffware Process Suite was officially released on 25 June
2003. This contains a number of new features to make it more attractive to
IT professionals who design, integrate and deploy medium to high volume
mission critical process-centric applications in complex IT environments. The
Staffware Process Suite is now available on a broad range of technology
platforms, so as to appeal to most organisations which utilise a diverse mix
of technologies. The Staffware Process Suite has consistently proven its
capability of enhancing our customers' investments in IT, by streamlining
interconnecting transactions, as the  Independent Process Layer'. We also
now integrate with a wide range of third party products.
Dividend
The Board of Directors recommends that a final dividend for 2003 of 5.0p
per ordinary share (2002: 4.0p), an increase of 25%, be paid on 27 April
2004, to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 02 April
2004, subject to approval at the AGM on 23 April 2004. This makes a total
of 7.0p for the year, compared with a total of 5.0p for 2002, an increase of
40% overall, recognising the continuing improvement in our performance, our
ability to generate cash and our desire to deliver value to our shareholders as
our strategy delivers increasing returns.
Staff
Our management and staff built on an excellent performance in 2002, with
significant improvements in all areas of our business. Specifically, the key
ratios of sales per sales person increased by 29%; revenue per support
person also rose by 27%, as did revenue per professional services person, by
10%. The majority of our regions achieved increased profits from increased
sales revenue. Our product development teams in the UK and the USA
applied their acknowledged expertise to develop market leading capability in
our technologies. Our finance and administration support teams enabled us
to tightly manage and finance our business, whilst our marketing functions
helped to generate more sales opportunities and increase Staffware's profile
in the fast developing BPM market. Overall, I believe we have a world class
team, who have responded magnificently to the opportunities and challenges
of last year.
Outlook
The market potential for BPM is becoming more clearly defined and
recognised with the release of more technology analysts' reports and
industry reviews. In particular, the first version of the Gartner Magic Quadrant
for BPM was released in June of last year with Staffware being highlighted
as one of only 4 companies (and the only non-American company) in their
top segment.
The increasing profile of the BPM market has gained the attention of some
of the leading IT providers. Some will be potential collaborators, whilst others
may well become competitors. This is a trend to be expected of any healthy
growing market and we at Staffware are gearing up to be an even more
attractive partner to such collaborators, whilst continuing to invest to
enhance our competitive position and leveraging our best of breed software
as market opportunities become more numerous. With this in mind, we
expect to increase the number of sales heads as the year progresses. 
Although the software licence business model can be inherently volatile
affecting the timing and recognition of revenues, the increase in our average
order value for licences, together with the leap in support maintenance
revenue, indicates the growing confidence of our customers in our
technology and organisation.  
With Staffware now acknowledged as the No. 1 European BPM software
provider** we believe we have a strong platform to leverage our leading
position on a global basis both organically and through mergers and
acquisitions including in the USA. Consequently, the Board looks forward to a
period of sustained growth.
