CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT 
INTRODUCTION 
The 12 months to 31 December 2004 was another difficult year for the business.  Markets for the Surface Technology Systems 
plc (STS) products did not recover as expected and the low volume of sales led to another year of losses. 
There were, however, some bright spots. Significant orders from multi-national production companies for multiple machines for 
use in production situations were gained as well as a growing prospects list.  Typically, such orders are for equipment that STS is 
able to sell at higher prices and at higher margins.  In addition, the new generation of  Pro-Range' machines won orders in 
competitive situations and the continuing efforts to increase efficiency have given STS a lower cost of production.  
In 2004, the directors were obliged under Section 142 of the Companies Act 1985 to convene an Extraordinary Board Meeting of 
the Company.  The purpose of the EGM was to consider whether any actions, and if so what actions, should be taken to deal with 
its low net asset value.  Currently discussions are taking place between STS and its parent company, Sumitomo Precision 
Products Co., Ltd., (SPP), to address this situation, similar to the action taken last year.  
STS's business is of a long-term nature and the potential opportunities from the increased use of MEMS and Nanotechnology in 
industrial and consumer products are still to be realised.  As a result of its belief in the future market potential for STS's 
products, STS continues to receive strong support from its parent company.  This support was demonstrated last year when SPP 
invested  5.0 million into the STS business by means of preference shares and, by so doing, strengthened the balance sheet. 
The directors believe that the steps already implemented to improve the operating efficiency of the Company and increase the 
order intake, coupled with the continued support of SPP, are the appropriate actions to take to deal with the on-going balance 
sheet situation.  
Results 
Sales declined to  14.0 million, some 24% lower than 2003. The reduction was principally related to the sales of systems, which 
fell by  4.8 million and was spread throughout all markets. 
Sales revenue is generated principally in three currencies, Sterling, US Dollars and Euros. In 2004, the proportions were 23%, 
50% and 27% respectively compared with 18%, 69% and 13% for 2003.  The US Dollar weakened by more than 7% during the 
year (11% during 2003) which, given the proportion of revenues in US Dollars, had a negative impact on the revenues reported 
by the Group.  
The spread of sales into the various sectors served has seen a significant increase in the business to the MEMS sector and a 
resurgence of the thin film head market.  The following table illustrates the STS business spread for 2003 and 2004.

The pattern of annual trading was very different to 2003 but similar to previous years, with approximately 33% of the sales being 
made in the last quarter of the year.  In 2003, the last quarter of the year was much higher at 50%. Exports to Europe increased to   
4 
16% of sales, from 12% in 2003; those to Asia, not including Japan, reduced to 26% (2003 - 35%).  Sales to the USA remained 
constant at 32% (2003 - 34%), whilst Japan increased from 19% in 2003 to 26% in 2004. 
The low volume of sales was the primary cause of the losses and, although further action was taken during the year to reduce 
costs, operating losses of  4.0 million were made in the year (2003 operating loss of  6.1 million).  The principal reason for the 
reduction in operating losses was the rationalisation and reorganisation that occurred in November 2003.  The pre-tax loss for 
2004 was  5.2 million compared with a loss of  7.1 million in 2003.  
An undeclared preference dividend of  92,000 (2003 -  nil) has been accrued in other reserves. 
Despite the loss before taxation of  5.2 million, the net cash outflow from operating activities was lower at  3.2 million, but 
compared with a net cash inflow of  3.8 million in 2003. The 2003 inflow was achieved, primarily, as a result of a   6.4 million 
reduction in working capital, reflecting the lower turnover and management initiatives.   These initiatives continued in 2004 to 
limit the cash outflow.  
The net cash outflow before financing was  4.9 million (2003 -  1.6m inflow).  The  5.0 million cash injection by SPP helped 
reduce the borrowings by  1.7 million to  16.9 million  (2003 -  18.6 million).  
Review of the year 
Low market demand and competitive pressures led to lower pricing during the year, a situation not helped by a weakening US 
Dollar throughout the year.   Action was taken to reduce operating costs at the end of 2003, which has benefited the results for 
2004. Initiatives have also been taken to improve operating efficiency. In combination, this has resulted in savings across the 
business.  
Many of the new approaches are financially driven and have led, as the results show, to reductions in stock and debtors.  The 
result of these actions, and the cash injection from SPP, was that the Group reduced its indebtedness, despite the losses.    
The gross margin for 2004 was 27.7% compared with 31.7% for 2003. The 2003 gross margin included exceptional charges of 
 1.0 million relating principally to inventory provisions. The gross margin in 2003 prior to making the exceptional charges was 
37.2%.  The gross margin percentage for 2004 was therefore 9.5 percentage points lower than 2003, excluding the exceptional 
charges. This decrease was a result of the lower sales volumes and factory throughput, a reduction in the number of tools where 
the installation was completed and accepted by the customer and the significant weakening of the US Dollar.  Various actions 
taken to reduce the cost base and improve processes relating to the management of materials, which commenced during 2003 and 
continued through 2004, have been successful. These initiatives, however, have been affected by the lack of orders and factory 
throughput.  The approaches are now embedded in the business and should flow through again during 2005. 
The operating costs were lowered significantly during the year with average employee numbers reduced by 48 and, with other 
savings, the operating and overhead costs have been reduced by some  2.5 million in 2004 compared with 2003.  These savings 
are significant and will benefit the business in the future. The dedication and commitment of the whole STS team during the 
prolonged market downturn cannot be questioned.   It has been very tough for all concerned and the team continues to rise to the 
challenges being posed.  I must also thank our major shareholder, SPP, for its continuing commitment and faith in the business. 
Paul Webb has resigned as Deputy Vice Chairman and Finance Director with effect from 31 March 2005 and will leave the 
Company's employment on completion of a period of notice on 30
 
June 2005.  The Board acknowledges and thanks Paul for the 
significant and valued contribution he has made to the Company since joining as Finance Director in 2002 and then as Deputy 
Vice Chairman and Finance Director from February 2004.  The Board wishes him every success in his future career.  STS has 
appointed John Saunders as Finance Director in succession to Paul.  John joined STS in April 2005 and brings to the Company a 
strong financial background, which will help the business to strengthen under the leadership of Mutsuo Mukuda.   
Andy Mcquarrie resigned from the Company in September 2004 and left his post as Business Development Director in January 
2005.   Andy had been with the Company since 1995, first as Strategic Marketing Director and latterly as Business Development 
Director.  The Board recognises his contribution to the Company and wishes him every success in his future career.

New product investment continued strongly, with some  2.9 million spent on research and development, and the  Pro-Range' 
continues to win new customers. In addition, further innovative solutions are being developed to help our customers in today's 
highly competitive markets and to enable STS to remain a market leader. 
STS continues to operate in a world of constant and rapid change.  Our customers are setting us tough challenges and our 
business is reacting quickly and has been re-shaped to meet those demands and remains the leader in the niche MEMS market.   
This is crucial to the Company's future and is a result of the progressive nature of our technologies and the markets we operate 
in. 
Outlook 
The impact of the very long downturn suffered by the STS markets has been very difficult for the Company to manage.  
Nevertheless, the Executive Team has continued to deal with the operational and strategic consequences of the downturn in 
agreement with the Board.  The Board remains confident that the markets for the STS Group's products will grow as new 
applications are accepted into production.  The enquiry level for machines has increased during the last year and a number of 
opportunities for multiple production orders are being pursued.  Trading in 2005 is not expected to be worse than in 2004 and is 
anticipated to improve because of the stronger pipeline of enquiries and the cost savings delivered.  In summary, demand for new 
product technology continues to be market driven and STS remains one of the leading equipment suppliers in its markets and is 
well placed to benefit from market improvement.  The Board remains committed to returning the business to profitability and 
will continue to explore opportunities to realise the long-term value of the business for the benefit of the shareholders.
