 4 Surgical Innovations Group plc  Annual report and accounts 2008 www.surginno.com
Introduction
As highlighted in my interim 
statement, 2008 was proving 
to be a challenging year due to 
the relocation of the business. 
The Group's objective for the second 
half of the year was to push forward 
with our growth plans to ensure 
we were properly structured and 
resourced for 2009, our target 
year for new product launches.
I am therefore pleased that we were 
able to achieve our objective and 
return a second half performance 
that gives the Board confidence for 
2009. Second half sales grew by 
48% from the first half of the year, 
to provide annual sales revenue of 
 4,312,000 (2007:  4,770,000). 
Whilst it is disappointing that we 
suffered an overall reduction in 
annual revenue it should be noted 
that 64% of this reduction relates 
to non core business. We have made 
an encouraging start to 2009 and 
revenues are at their highest levels 
since the formation of the business. 
Our gross margin for the year, 
which includes royalty income 
from Cardinal Health on medical 
devices and the licence fee 
from Rolls-Royce on industrial 
products, rose to 53% (2007: 50%). 
Furthermore, the benefits of our 
in-house manufacturing and revised 
product mix resulted in a gross 
margin of 59% in the second half 
of the year compared to 44% in the 
first half. Other operating expenses 
reduced by  208,000, despite the 
relocation of the business and the 
associated increased establishment 
costs. However, we will need to 
increase this area of expenditure 
in the current year to ensure 
that we are able to provide the 
appropriate levels of service 
to our growing customer base 
and product portfolio.
With net interest receivable 
of  40,000 we have delivered an 
increase in pre-tax profits of 12% 
to  820,000 (2007:  731,000). 
With applicable tax losses within 
the MIS business now fully utilised, 
we have a tax charge for the 
year of  190,000, resulting in 
retained profits of  630,000 
(2007:  765,000).
2008 was a difficult year 
for the Group and the Board is 
now looking forward to a period 
of stability. We have several key 
objectives for 2009, including the 
launch of products developed during 
2008, a strategic reappraisal of our 
Autologous Blood Transfusion (ABT) 
business and, most importantly, 
a review of our US operations 
to ensure we maximise the 
opportunities open to us at this 
time. The penetration of our 
products in the US to date has 
been below our expectations.
Group restructure
Following the resignation of 
Stuart Moran in July 2008 we have 
restructured the Group to ensure 
the most efficient use of senior 
management time and resources. 
From January 2009 we have been 
operating with two separate 
trading companies:
M  Surgical Innovations Limited (SI) 
- design, development, 
manufacture and sale of devices 
for both medical and industrial 
markets. This will include 
products for both SI and 
OEM partners; and
M  Haemocell Limited - autologous 
blood and associated medical 
device products. 
It is the Board's intention to 
undertake a reappraisal of the 
Haemocell business and we will 
be utilising external resources to 
develop this strategy. At the end 
of 2009 we will be in a position 
to determine whether we remain 
in this sector and also assess the 
value of the business.
Chairman's statement
Summary of Chairman's statement
  I am pleased we were able to achieve 
our objectives and return a second half 
performance that gives the Board 
confidence for 2009.  
  Our main objective this year is to develop 
instrumentation for the next generation 
of surgical techniques, namely Single Port 
Access surgery.  
  I am looking for an immediate return 
to sales growth in 2009 to complement 
projected margin improvements through 
in-house manufacture.

Business review Governance Accounts Overview
YelloPort  Plus
We have concluded the initial 
development of our YelloPort  Plus 
port access system and this is now 
subject to a global roll-out through 
our current distributor network. 
As with any new project, following 
increased usage of the device 
within the surgical field, there are 
enhancements and refinements 
needed and 2008 saw the 
commencement of these changes. 
We aim to have these changes 
completed by June 2009, therefore 
ensuring the long term success of 
the device. Sales continued to grow, 
especially in Europe, through our 
experienced and established 
distributors. However we have had 
difficulties in the US, where despite 
successful product evaluations 
and investment in clinical support, 
we have still failed to establish 
a suitable level of business. We have 
been in dialogue with our master 
distributor and await their revised 
implementation strategy for the 
product line. YelloPort  Plus is the 
ideal cost-effective solution for the 
US market, especially during the 
current economic downturn where 
hospitals are looking to save funds 
on every surgical procedure. It is, 
therefore, something of a frustration 
to the Board that we have not seen 
the returns on our US investment 
to date and we intend this to be 
resolved before the end of the 
current year.
Industrial
The industrial business is centred 
around the licence agreement with 
Rolls-Royce and any forthcoming 
design work, together with an 
ongoing development project 
with an international power 
generation company. 
We have invested our design skills 
with both companies during the 
year and look forward to a return 
on this investment through sales 
of actual devices derived from the 
manufactured prototypes. We are 
confident in the abilities of our 
design team to deliver working 
and acceptable solutions to both 
organisations during 2009.
Original equipment manufacture 
(OEM) 
The growth strategy of the 
business is based upon the 
distribution of SI branded products 
through the independent dealer 
network and the manufacturing 
of OEM laparoscopic devices. 
We continue to build relationships 
with Teleflex Medical, Gyrus, 
Olympus and Cardinal Health 
and it is testament to our design 
and manufacturing skills that 
we continue to be approached 
to develop and manufacture 
products for such highly 
renowned medical companies.
R&D and new products
During the year significant 
investment was made in 
product development both for 
the SI distribution network and 
our OEM partners. We look forward 
to the imminent European launch 
of our latest product for obesity 
surgery together with new 
instrument technology for 
a key OEM partner. 
Towards the end of 2008 we 
began production of two further 
OEM laparoscopic products. This 
increase in OEM business is a key 
part of our overall growth strategy . 
By the end of June 2009 we will have 
launched improvements to both 
our resposable  YelloPort  Plus 
and disposable Quick range. By the 
end of the year, the fully reusable 
Logic Range will be redeveloped 
to provide a more competitive 
alternative to the current 
market leaders. 
As previously highlighted, 
our main objective this year is to 
develop instrumentation for the next 
generation of surgical techniques, 
namely Single Port Access (SPA) 
surgery. We have already made 
significant strides in this area 
and believe we have the technology 
to deliver commercially viable 
products in this exciting new 
development of surgery . 
Clinical Advisory Board (CAB)
To complement and assist our 
product development programme 
at the end of 2007 we established 
a Clinical Advisory Board under 
the Chairmanship of our eminent 
founder and Non-executive Clinical 
Director , Professor Mike McMahon. 
I am delighted to advise that in 
February 2009 the CAB met for 
the first time at the new facilities 
and that the time spent together 
was a great success. Discussions 
took place on the Group's 
development strategy and our 
move into SPA surgery together 
with a critical review of our 
current product portfolio. 
If we are to retain our position 
as a leading innovator within 
the laparoscopic sector it is vitally 
important that we maintain and 
develop relationships with surgeons. 
I am most grateful to all members 
of the CAB for availing us of their 
valuable time and in particular, 
Dr Gary Gecelter for flying over from 
the US and imparting his extensive 
knowledge in the SPA surgery field.
Employees
As a consequence of the 
business relocation we have 
been able to expand our design 
and development team which 
is now a department of twelve 
out of a current staff level of 52. 
With an in-house manufacturing 
strategy clearly established, we 
continue to recruit in this area 
and in December 2008 employed 
an additional ten colleagues to 
cope with production requirements. 
We look forward to the future 
development of this department 
with implementation of phases two 
and three (mill turning and injection 
moulding) of the manufacturing 
strategy in 2009 to complement 
a proposed class 100,000 
assembly cleanroom. 
Outlook
Against a reduction in annual 
revenue I am looking for an 
immediate return to sales growth 
in 2009 to complement projected 
margin improvements through 
in-house manufacture.
The facilities are now in place, 
new products are ready for 
launch and with the current world 
economic situation, the Group 
is well placed to take advantage 
of our established resposable  
concept. As a company heavily 
geared to exports, we should 
continue to benefit from the 
low value of Sterling against 
the Dollar and Euro. 
Difficult issues need to be 
addressed in 2009, including 
our position regarding the ABT 
business and, most importantly, 
continuing the challenge of 
establishing YelloPort  Plus in 
the US market. However, we have 
made an encouraging start to 
the new financial year and I look 
forward to reporting on the 
interim position later in 2009.
Finally, I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank all Group 
employees and my fellow Directors 
for their continued support and 
dedication during a year of 
significant challenges.
