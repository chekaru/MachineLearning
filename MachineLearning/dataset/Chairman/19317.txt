 04 Autologic Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
Since my appointment in October 2007 to the Board 
of Autologic Holdings plc as Chairman, there have 
been significant changes for the Group, and more 
latterly, unprecedented challenges for the economy 
and our industry.
SIGNIFICANT EVENTS
Last year I explained that, following the appointment  
of Avril Palmer-Baunack as Chief Executive Officer  
in November 2007 and Andrew Somerville as Group 
Finance Director shortly afterwards, there would  
be further changes to the Group. During 2008,  
many of these changes have been implemented  
and I believe we now have an appropriate platform  
for the management of the operations in the current 
economic downturn. 
The management structure of the Group has  
been simplified, resulting in a leaner organisation  
with reduced overheads. Core elements of the 
management of our UK distribution activity have been 
centralised within our corporate office at Northampton, 
resulting in more direct lines of communication, 
stronger controls and a more streamlined operation. 
Within our UK technical services business area,  
a review of activities has resulted in the elimination  
of under-performing services at one depot and the 
provision for closure of another depot. 
During the year, we made significant progress  
in resolving many of the outstanding issues that 
remained following the loss in November 2007 of  
the contract with Ford Motor Company Ltd ( Ford'), 
whilst maintaining a positive working relationship  
with Ford. Consequently, in the 2008 results we have  
been able to reverse provisions established in 2007  
of  10.6 million before tax. This is clearly an excellent 
outcome for the Group, which strengthens the Group's 
Balance Sheet and eliminates major uncertainties for 
the future. 
In July 2008, we completed the sale of our minority 
shareholding in Edmunds Holdings Company Inc.,  
a company incorporated in the United States ( US'). 
This had followed a strategic decision, particularly  
in light of the declining US economic situation at  
the time, to dispose of the interest and generated  
cash proceeds of  2.0 million. A loss on disposal  
of  3.1 million has been recorded in the 2008 results. 
The further deterioration in the US automotive sector 
experienced since then has endorsed our decision.

SUMMARY
The progress made in 
restructuring the business, 
coupled with the Group's net  
debt and gearing position  
as at 31 December 2008,  
is encouraging.
We are cautious in our outlook  
for 2009 and, even with the 
measures taken to reduce costs, 
we fully expect the current year  
to be as challenging as 2008.  
We believe that once the 
economic situation improves, 
which we do not expect to be 
before 2010, the business will 
be well-positioned to develop 
in a controlled and profitable 
manner.  Autologic Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008 05
In the UK, during the second half of the year we have 
seen an unprecedented downturn within our industry. 
New car registrations, whilst having been broadly flat 
year-on-year in the first half of 2008, reduced by 19% 
in the third quarter of 2008 compared to the same 
period in 2007, and by 27% in the final quarter of 2008 
compared to the same period in 2007. The downturn 
continues as I write this report and we expect new  
car registrations for 2009 to be significantly lower than 
in 2008. Although we were well advanced with the 
implementation of our restructuring by the end of the 
first half of the year, Management has had to respond 
even more quickly to reduce the cost base of the 
Group and to position it for future anticipated demand. 
Further restructuring activities may be required in  
2009 and beyond to respond to any continuation of 
the downturn in the automotive marketplace. We will 
continue to monitor the position carefully and react  
to changes as necessary. I am confident that with its 
spread of activities and with the continuing support  
of its stakeholders, the Group will emerge from this 
difficult period a stronger and leaner business and 
well-positioned for sustainable growth. 
FINANCIAL RESULTS
Revenue from continuing operations for the year ended 
31 December 2008 reduced by 5% to  171.1 million 
(2007 :  180.7 million). UK revenue fell by 10% to 
 145.8 million, reflecting the marked slowdown in  
new car registrations in the third and fourth quarters. 
Revenues from Benelux increased by 26% to  
 23.1 million and sales from the Czech Republic 
increased significantly to  2.2 million. The 
strengthening Euro was a significant factor in these 
increases, although we also won new customers  
in both regions. These markets have not yet slowed 
down to the same extent as already experienced in  
the UK marketplace. 
Operating profit from continuing operations (before 
exceptional items) reduced to  0.5 million from  
 5.5 million in 2007. This reduction in profitability  
was due to many factors, not least of which was  
the fact that the efficiency of the UK business was 
impacted by the ongoing restructuring and the many 
historical issues requiring resolution, coupled with 
unprecedented rises in fuel prices and the dramatic 
decline in economic conditions. Our Benelux 
operations performed satisfactorily as their markets 
remained strong relative to the decline experienced  
in the UK. However, we do expect a decline in the 
Benelux market during 2009. 
The Group incurred exceptional costs of  12.2 million 
before tax during the year (2007 :  6.3 million), which 
are explained in greater detail in the Business Review. 
Discontinued operations, which in 2008 relate to the 
transactions resulting from the exit of the Ford contract 
in November 2007, generated a post-tax income 
(primarily by way of the reversal of provisions created 
in 2007) of  8.6 million (2007 : loss of  20.6 million). 
The statutory result for the year, including exceptional 
items and discontinued operations, was a profit of 
 0.1 million (2007 : loss of  22.6 million). Business 
performance basic earnings per share decreased  
to 0.9p (2007 : 5.0p) and on a statutory basis the 
basic earnings per share was 0.1p (2007 : loss per  
share 38.2p).
Net debt as at 31 December 2008 was  4.0 million 
(2007 :  3.3 million). Considering the significant 
exceptional cash costs incurred during 2008 relating  
to both 2007 and 2008 restructuring charges, this is 
an excellent result and well ahead of expectations. 
DIVIDEND
The Directors will not be recommending a dividend 
(2007 :  nil) to Shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting. 06 Autologic Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2008
CAPITAL REDUCTION
In December 2008, the exercise to reduce the capital 
of the Company and to eliminate the deficit on retained 
earnings was completed. The Balance Sheets of both 
the Company and the Consolidated Accounts of the 
Group as at 31 December 2008 reflect this change, 
which was registered by the Registrar of Companies 
in December 2008. The authorised share capital of  
the Company now comprises 100,000,000 Ordinary 
shares of 0.1p each. 
ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION
We are also asking Members to approve the adoption 
of new Articles of Association, primarily to reflect the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006. An explanation 
of the main differences between the new and the 
existing Articles of Association is set out on pages  
73 to 76 of this document.
BOARD CHANGES AND STAFF
Russell Brown, formerly Chief Operating Officer,  
and Roger Putnam, previously Non-Executive Director, 
left the Board on 9 April 2008 and 15 October 2008 
respectively. On behalf of my colleagues, I would like 
to thank them for their contributions to the Group.
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all  
of our employees for their hard work and commitment 
in what has been a very difficult trading environment. 
With their ongoing support I am confident that 
Autologic will continue to provide market-leading 
services to the automotive industry.
OUTLOOK
The progress made in restructuring the business, 
coupled with the Group's net debt and gearing 
position as at 31 December 2008, is encouraging.  
The Board remains focused on controlling this position. 
The economic situation in the UK in general and in  
the automotive marketplace in particular continues  
to be challenging. The short to medium-term outlook 
for the automotive market is uncertain. Management 
has moved quickly and we have taken and continue  
to progress with what we believe to be the necessary 
steps to downsize the business to reflect the expected 
level of new car registrations and production in 2009. 
Naturally we are cautious in our outlook for 2009 and, 
even with the measures taken to reduce costs, we fully 
expect the current year to be as challenging as 2008. 
We believe that once the economic situation improves, 
which we do not expect to be before 2010, the 
business will be well-positioned to develop in a 
controlled and profitable manner.
