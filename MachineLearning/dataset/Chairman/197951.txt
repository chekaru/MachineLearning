 Chairman's  statement
1 Timeweave plc for the period ended 31st December 2010
Period ended 31st December 2010
Overview
Timeweave plc ('Timeweave',  the Company' or 'the Group') is
the holding company of a group which principally comprises a
50% holding in Amalgamated Racing Limited ('AMRAC') and
cash deposits.
AMRAC is an equally owned joint venture company between
Racecourse Media Services Limited (which is in turn owned by a
number of the UK's foremost racecourses and Racecourse
Investments Limited) and Timeweave. AMRAC holds exclusive
licences with 31 racecourses to broadcast pictures, audio and
data from these courses to licensed betting offices in the United
Kingdom and Republic of Ireland on its dedicated television
channel, TurfTV.
Introduction
The thirteen months to 31st December 2010 saw the Group
deliver a strong operating performance, streamline its activities
and enhance its Board level capabilities.
The Board is recommending a significantly increased final
dividend of 1.6 pence per share which will bring the dividend for
the thirteen month period to 31st December 2010 to a total
of 2.6 pence per share (twelve months to 30th November 2009:
1.7 pence per share).
On 18th February 2011 Timeweave announced that David
Craven will be joining the Group as Chief Executive Officer in
April 2011. David, aged 44, has been employed by the Tote since
February 2005 and is currently Managing Director of Totepool
and E-Gaming. David has extensive experience in the Gaming
Sector having previously held senior roles with UK Betting plc
and Wembley plc.
On 31st May 2010 the Company completed the disposal of the
entire issued share capital of Alphameric Solutions Limited ('ASL')
(comprising the entire Solutions business) to Orbis Holdings
Limited (a subsidiary of NDS Group Limited ('NDS')) for a total
gross consideration of  15.475m. It was the Board's view that to
remain a credible force ASL needed to be larger and enjoy a wider
portfolio of products. Following an approach from NDS an offer
was received which the Board believed gave good value for the
ASL business and maximised shareholder value.
The sale of ASL included the brand name Alphameric and as a
consequence the remaining companies in the Group changed their
corporate and trading names to Timeweave on 23rd June 2010.
The disposal of ASL resulted in Timeweave no longer meeting the
requirements of the UKLA's Listing Rules. As a result, Timeweave
moved its listing to AIM, a market operated by the London Stock
Exchange, on 24th June 2010.
Timeweave's financial year end was changed to 31st December
with effect from the thirteen months to 31st December 2010.
AMRAC Media Rights
On 17th December 2009 AMRAC announced that it had signed
long term contracts extending its exclusive Licensed Betting
Office ('LBO') media rights for 13 of the Jockey Club's
racecourses and 17 other independent racecourses. The new five-
year agreements will commence on the expiry of the current
agreements in March 2013 and run until 31st March 2018.
On 29th June 2010 AMRAC announced that it had successfully
signed a new long-term contract extending its exclusive LBO
media rights for Ascot Racecourse. The new five-year agreement
will commence on the expiry of the current agreement in April
2013, and will run until 31st March 2018.
The extension of the media rights underpins the business
going forward.
Results
In accordance with IFRS 5 'Non-current Assets Held for Sale and
Discontinued Operations' we have reported the results for the
thirteen months to 31st December 2010 excluding the trading
performance for ASL and have restated the prior period
comparative. Included within the consolidated income statement
is the line 'Loss for the financial period from discontinued
operations' which includes the trading performance of ASL
together with the loss arising on disposal (2009: trading
performance for the twelve months to 30th November 2009).
The Group's interest in its joint venture AMRAC is
proportionately consolidated in accordance with IAS 31 'Interests
in Joint Ventures' such that 50% of AMRAC's revenues, costs and
balance sheet headings are included within the Group's
consolidated financial information.
Income Statement
Revenue for the thirteen months to 31st December 2010 was
 29.9m (twelve months to 30th November 2009:  26.2m) which
produced an operating profit before exceptional items of  8.0m
(twelve months to 30th November 2009:  6.7m). Operating
profit from continuing operations (after exceptional items) was
 7.5m (twelve months to 30th November 2009:  6.7m).
Earnings per share from continuing operations (basic and diluted)
were 2.6 pence (twelve months to 30th November 2009: (basic
and diluted) 2.4 pence).
The disposal of ASL resulted in a loss on discontinued operations of
 2.2m (twelve months to 30th November 2009: profit  1.4m).
Earnings per share after exceptional items and the loss (twelve months
to 30th November 2009: earnings) from discontinued operations
was 1.6 pence (twelve months to 30th November 2009: 3.0 pence).
The exceptional administrative expenses of  550,000 for the
thirteen months to 31st December 2010 relate principally to the
early termination of the former Chief Executive's employment
contract (twelve months to 30th November 2009:  Nil). Statement of Financial Position and Cash Flows
At 31st December 2010 the Group had total consolidated cash and
cash equivalent balances of  31.9m including  9.9m from its share
of AMRAC's cash and cash equivalents and  2.0m held in escrow
against the warranties and indemnities given in respect of the sale
of ASL (30th November 2009:  20.8m including  6.2m being its
share of AMRAC's cash and cash equivalents).
At 31st December 2010 a loan from the Company to AMRAC of
 4m was outstanding; this was subsequently repaid in full in
February 2011.
AMRAC's customer supply contracts typically run annually from
1st January with a number of large customers paying annually in
advance for the service.
In December 2009 AMRAC entered into a series of contracts which
extended the majority of its media rights contracts until 2018;
certain of these contracts required advance payments of
approximately  10m to be made by AMRAC which consequently
reduced its cash balances.
AMRAC has a distribution of profits policy which results in
quarterly dividend payments to its shareholders.
Disposal of  
Alphameric Solutions Limited ('ASL')
On 31st May 2010 the disposal of ASL to Orbis Holdings Limited,
a subsidiary of NDS Group Limited, was completed for a total gross
consideration of  15.475m. Of the consideration,  2.0m has been
placed in an escrow account to be utilised against any claims made
by the acquirer under the disposal agreement arising within 18
months from 31st May 2010.

of 1.0 pence per share (2009: 0.75 pence per share).
Outlook
Over the last thirteen months the Group has gone through
significant change both in terms of its trading operations and its
management team. We now start the year with a reshaped Board,
a strong balance sheet and the imminent arrival of a new Chief
Executive. Whilst trading conditions for our joint venture business,
AMRAC, remain affected by the economic conditions in its markets,
particularly in Ireland, your Board will continue to look to invest in
this business to generate appropriate returns for shareholders.
