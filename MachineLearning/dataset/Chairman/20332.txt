 Chairman's statement
I am pleased to announce the results of Avingtrans plc for the year ending 31 May 2007, another period of growth in sales and
assets for the Group. The growth included two aerospace acquisitions which were completed during the year; 75% of Sigma
Precision Components Limited in June 2006, together with 100% of B&D Patterns Limited in September 2006. The acquisition
of B&D contributed to a growth of order intake, sales turnover and EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation) to new record levels. 
Stainless Metalcraft Limited and C&H Precision Finishers Limited, our medical engineering and turbine blade facilities, were
less buoyant than expected during the period, caused by a significant reduction in order uptake early in the year, on agreed
schedules from our major medical component customer and a delay in supply of turbine blades for repolishing in the third
quarter from Rolls Royce. 
Existing operations for the Group finished only marginally ahead of the previous year's performance instead of the growth
planned for the period. 
Higher interest payments from loans used to support the funding of the acquisitions, an increased tax charge and a greater
number of shares in issue all contributed to earnings per share below expectations for the year and below the previous year ended
31 May 2006. 
Much of our effort at Metalcraft in this period was engaged in successfully seeking replacement work for the future to continue
its pattern of profitable growth in the supply of high technology components for the medical and research sectors in Europe,
Asia and North America with a number of new customers and projects being secured. Business at the Jena Group of companies
continued to grow successfully during the period and finished ahead of plan. 
As a result of the lower than expected growth in our continuing businesses during the period the Group made an announcement
in May 2007 that year end results would not meet the Board's expectations for the year ending 31 May 2007. The Board dealt
with these issues during the remainder of the year and continued its growth programme through product development, market
development and ongoing investment in productivity enhancing processes and machinery.
Financial performance
EBITDA was  5.0m (2006:  4.1m) up 24% on improved turnover of  40.0m (2006:  32.5m), an increase of 23%. 
Operating profit for the period was  3.3m (2006:  2.8m). Profit before tax increased to  2.6m (2006:  2.4m as restated). Profit
after tax following an increased tax charge fell to  1.7m (2006:  1.9m as restated), representing a 10.0% return on net assets
(2006: 15.3% as restated).
Basic earnings per share before goodwill amortisation was 13.3p (2006: 16.0p as restated). Diluted earnings per share before
goodwill amortisation was 12.8p (2006: 15.0p as restated).
Cash flow from operating activities for the year was  3.5m (2006:  2.7m). The net debt at the year-end was  10.5m (2006:
 3.3m) resulting in a gearing of 63.1% (2006: 26.0%) on net assets of  16.6m (2006:  12.7m).
The pre-tax figures for the year ended 31 May 2007 and comparative figures for the year ended 31 May 2006 have been adjusted
in respect of the adoption of FRS 20  Share based payment' to the extent of  67,000 and  26,000 respectively.
During the year capital projects totalling  1.9m (2006:  1.2m) were implemented across the Group and  279,000 was spent on
development costs related to the future introduction of new products (2006:  9,000).
Dividend
The Directors, in view of the continuing strength and growth prospects of the Group together with the addition of Sigma UK,
Sigma China and B&D, are recommending to the shareholders at the AGM a final dividend of 0.75p per share making a total
of 1.25p for the year (2006: 1.0p). This will be paid on 23 November 2007 to shareholders on the register at 19 October 2007.

Acquisitions and investments
The acquisition of Sigma, a British based aerospace company with plans to develop an aerospace manufacturing facility in
Chengdu, China, for a consideration of  0.3m was completed on 19 June 2006. Funding for the acquisition was from the Group's
cash reserves. Since June 2006 further funding of  0.6m has been made available to build, equip, staff and obtain accreditations
for a new 30,000 square feet aerospace manufacturing plant in Chengdu, China. The new plant was officially opened on 3 April
2007 after gaining all necessary accreditations to commence supplying test components to the European and American
aerospace industries in March 2007. Letters of intent in excess of  2m for product supply were received during the year.
The acquisition of B&D, an aerospace specialist supplier to Rolls Royce and other aero engine manufacturers, for  6.9m was
completed on 21 September 2006. The funding for the acquisition was raised through the issue of new shares at a price of  1.25
each together with further loan capital from the Group's bankers HSBC. During the eight months of ownership of B&D a great
deal of effort has been put into improving customer relations, development of new markets and the strengthening of
management. This work is continuing.
Development of new traffic camera posts at Crown UK continued during the year as did our collaboration with Loughborough
University based Vehicle Occupancy Limited on the development of a new, unique, laser based camera for the detection of the
number of occupants in a motor vehicle passing within its range. A prototype of the device, which could be employed in a wide
range of traffic management situations, was successfully demonstrated at the Traffex exhibition in Birmingham in April 2007.
Work on a pre-production unit continues.  
Acquisitions continue to be part of the growth plan of the Group and we continue to investigate opportunities as they arise.  
Review of the year
The year under review has been varied. The first half, ended 30 November 2006, as reported in our interim results was, for the
Group, a strong period of order intake, sales and profitability and included the acquisition of 75% of Sigma and 100% of B&D.
Some concern on order uptake on scheduled deliveries of MRI scanner units to our major customer for these units arose during
the first half with sales significantly lower than programmed. It was believed at that time that the shortfall would be made up in
the second half.
The second half of the year ended 31 May 2007 saw continuing success in the Group's development of Sigma's Chinese facility
and the integration of B&D into the Group with continued growth at the Jena Group, our German operation, and work from new
customers for Metalcraft.  However, the significant downturn in order uptake compared to previously agreed levels by our major
customer for medical components at Metalcraft, as reported earlier, together with a supplier delay at C&H, our turbine blade
finisher for Rolls Royce and the order delays from Network Rail on Crown UK for signal posts for the West Coast line, affected
our internal performance. A number of successful actions were taken to minimise the effect on our growth programme including
personnel reductions, order replacement programmes and inventory reduction. It was not, however, possible to replace the whole
of the MRI scanner component orders not taken up and the year ended at a level of sales and pre-tax profitability, though higher
than 2006, below our expectations.
Directors and senior management
Since the year end the Group has reorganised its subsidiaries into three divisions: Aerospace, Medical and Research and
Industrial Products. The heads of these divisions report to the Managing Director. It is felt that this new structure will improve
control and reporting as we grow. 
In accordance with the Articles of Association, Stephen Bruh and Steven Lawrence retire from the Board by rotation and offer
themselves for re-election at the AGM scheduled for 18 October 2007.
Share warrants 
S J Lawrence exercised and retained the balance of his share warrants (112,000) in the company in May 2007.  K M Baker
retains his outstanding share warrants (208,000).

Outlook
Following the reduction in demand for MRI scanner components in 2006 and 2007 the Group has been active and successful in
seeking opportunities with other companies requiring supplies of high technology cryogenic pressure vessels that are the
speciality of Metalcraft, our largest company based in Cambridgeshire. Orders with long term future growth potential have been
particularly targeted and secured. These include components for two new medical customers, submersibles for ocean rescue
modules and casings for a new type of power unit being developed by a world leader in aerospace engine technology. These
long term projects, if successful, will increasingly contribute profits to the group over the next 3 to 5 years.
The Group continues to develop its aerospace capability with repeat and new orders from Rolls Royce at B&D. Sigma has now
received accreditation from a number of potential US and EU customers and is processing a number of start-up orders and
quotations. C&H has resumed normal service with its major customer after some disruptions in 2007 and has opened a new
facility in the Bristol area to support a regional growth in demand.
The Jena Group has started the new year with a continued significant upturn in demand for its product on the back of the strength
in the German machinery market and is currently enjoying record levels of orders.
After the year end, on 1 June 2007, the Group acquired 7% of Vehicle Occupancy Limited for a consideration of  200,000 and
is looking forward to the development of the pre-production unit.
As an AIM traded company, we are not required to adopt IFRS until the financial year ending 31 May 2008.  Our IFRS
conversion project is progressing well and we look forward to presenting our interim results for the six months to 30 November
2007 under IFRS.
Despite the recent turbulence in commodity prices and the financial markets the outlook for the Group remains positive for
growth in the current year.
In closing I should like to thank, on behalf of the Board of Directors, all our employees for their efforts in the past year.
