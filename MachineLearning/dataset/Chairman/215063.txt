CHAIRMAN'S REVIEW 
 
 
The past year has been a period of great financial turbulence which has seen a flight from what are perceived as 
Risk Assets and this has resulted in a reduction in the value of our holdings.  Additionally the drilling results of our 
two major holdings namely Sterling Energy Plc and Desire Petroleum Plc have been disappointing. 
 
Sterling: 
Sterling has been fully funded for the exploration well in Kurdistan but after nearly eighteen months of problems 
and difficulties the well was plugged and abandoned.  Sterling remains well financed with some $100 million of 
cash plus the cash flow from Mauritania which more than covers the overheads.  Sterling has recently announced 
that they had sold 50% of their stake in the Cameroon field in return for a contribution to past costs and a 
commitment to fully fund the joint development including drilling one exploration well.  The Border dispute has not 
yet been settled and so the programme remains suspended until further progress on this issue. 
 
Desire: 
Desire completed its five well programme on its North Falkland licence acreage without a discovery and has 
subsequently completed its Seismic logging programme to enhance its knowledge of the field's geology.  Desire 
would need to raise further finance to drill any additional wells.  On the 12
 
October Rockhopper announced that it 
had agreed a Farm In with Desire on their licence area adjacent to Rockhopper's Sea Lion discovery which for fully 
funding the drilling costs of one well will earn a forty per cent interest in that well.  The recent Rockhopper drilling 
results give cause for optimism concerning Desire's acreage adjacent to the Sea Lion discovery. 
 
Argos Resources Plc: 
Argos, our remaining holding, has now completed the Seismic mapping of its Licences revealing a number of 
interesting targets and if it is to commence drilling will have to raise fresh capital, or find a partner to fund the 
exploration campaign in exchange for a stake in the acreage. 
 
The Future: 
In all my previous statements in both the Interim and Final Reports I have indicated that it was your Boards 
intention to investigate various alternatives that would create on-going value for our shareholders as an alternative 
to returning capital to our shareholders.  We will continue with this policy during the coming year.

DIRECTORS' REPORT 
FOR THE YEAR ENDING 30 JUNE 2011 
  
The Directors present their annual report and the audited financial statements of Westmount Energy Limited (the 
Company ) for the year ended 30 June 2011.  
 
PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES 
The principal activity of the Company is, and continues to be, investment holding. Development of the Company s 
activities and its prospects are reviewed in the chairman s review on page 3. 
 
The Company was incorporated in Jersey on 1 October 1992 under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended, 
and is a public Company with registered number 53623. 
 
The Company is not resident in the United Kingdom and is therefore, not a close Company within the meaning of the 
United Kingdom Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. 
 
DIRECTORS AND DIRECTORS' INTERESTS 
The Directors during the year and subsequently to the date of this report were as follows: 
 
P J Richardson      
P R Anderson 
M Bradlow  (Non-Executive Chairman) 
 
M S D Yates was appointed on 1 October 2008 and resigned on 30 June 2011.  
 
The Company does not have any service contracts with the Directors.  However, Lion Crest Investment Ltd is 
entitled to a commission of 3% of profits arising from the Company s current interest held through Desire Petroleum 
Plc. Commission paid during the year amounted to  43,288 (2010:  56,082) of which  93,972 (2010:  50,684) was 
outstanding at the year end. Previously the commissions were paid to Ridge House Resources Limited, a company in 
which the late D G Williams was interested, however due to a restructure the rights to the commissions were re 
assigned on 7 July 2011 for all new and existing commissions due. On 25 July 2011, the outstanding commissions 
amounting to  93,972 were paid to Lion Crest Investment Ltd in full. 
 
The Directors, from time to time, are entitled to an aggregate bonus calculated at 5% of the gross profit realised from 
any sale of shares in Sterling Energy plc. 
 
RESULTS AND DIVIDENDS 
The result for the year is set out on page 8 in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.  The Directors do not 
recommend the payment of a dividend in respect of these financial statements (2010:  Nil). Further details on the 
Company s activities during the year have been set out in the Chairman s Review.   
 
AUDITORS 
In the case of each of the persons who are Directors at the time when the report is approved, the following applies: 
 so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information (information needed by the 
Company s auditors in connection with preparing their report) of which the Company s auditors are 
unaware, and 
 each Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director in order to make 
himself aware of any relevant information and to establish that the Company s auditors are aware of 
that information. 
 
The auditors, Moore Stephens, have indicated their willingness to continue in office, and a resolution that they be re-
appointed will be proposed at the next general meeting. 
 
POLICY AND PRACTICE OF PAYMENT OF CREDITORS 
The Company does not follow any specified code or standard on payment practice.  However, it is Company policy 
to settle all debts owing on a timely basis, taking account of the credit period given by each supplier.  The Company 
has few trade creditors and the majority of year end creditors were due to professional advisers.  For this reason, the 
Directors consider that the publication of the number of creditor days would not provide meaningful information.
