The numbers say it all.
Whatman's capabilities in Filtration and Separation (Separations )
are second to none:
  The Whatman brand remains synonymous with quality and our 
products continue to be regarded as the benchmark for the industry.
 There is an opportunity to aggressively increase market share in
our existing core geographic markets and to penetrate selected
other countries where we currently have only a foothold.
However, the Company's forays into
certain new product areas have been
less successful:
  HemaSure, the blood filter business
we acquired in May 2001, suffered
from a succession of setbacks and
we ran out of time and patience.
HemaSure was sold in December
2002 (transaction completed 
March 2003).
  Biometra, the German thermocyclers
and laboratory instruments business
acquired in April 1993, has been
suffering from difficult conditions in
the German market and has not
sustained the growth of previous
years.
  Cambridge Molecular Technology,
the leading edge DNA purification
business acquired in September
1999, was poorly managed, leaving
its exciting development programmes
orphaned and beached.
Some of the technologies and products
acquired during our shopping spree in
the 1990's are exciting, but we have
done too little with them - until now:
  Polyfiltronics, the multiwell business
we acquired in January 1996, gave
us the opportunity to enter the
growing market for high throughput
screening. 
  High performance membranes were
acquired over a period of nine years;
and, as a result, we possess top of
the range, internationally
competitive, high performance
products. Although we sustained 
our technical edge, we failed to
market our membranes actively and
are only now actively beginning to
exploit a number of large potential
applications and sales opportunities
around the world.
  FTA is the technology in our stable
with the greatest probability of
transforming the fortunes of our
Company: the proposition - DNA
storage, at room temperature 
- is extremely powerful in an
extraordinarily extensive range of
sectors, from increasingly
widespread DNA databasing (e.g.
immigration, sex offenders) to
forensics to medical diagnostics to
food safety. Because many of these
sectors are highly regulated or
dominated by government
purchasing, the take-up rate can be
slow - a fact which we so far
underestimated. But today's
enormous emphasis, throughout the
world, on national security, health
and safety provides us with
opportunities which we are well
placed to seize. 
A simple strategy  
Strip out inefficiencies in the business
and renew the business model: 
  Tighter, more targeted, new product
development and more rigorous
project management within R&D.
The projects in place when I took
over as chairman in October
suffered from inadequate focus and
low success rates. 
The number of projects has been
reduced with correspondingly higher
out-turn expectations. This sharper
focus will also result in shorter
gestation periods and lower unit
costs.
  Rationalisation of the Company's
manufacturing facilities: the current
14 plants will be consolidated onto 
4 state-of-the-art sites. Progressively
the benefits will be: 
- GMP standards; better quality
control and overall quality
performance; 
- Improved workflow, labour
efficiency, machine yields and
capacity utilisation; 
- More effective procurement of
machine parts, moulds and materials; 
- Better controlled inventories of
intermediate and finished stock; 
- Greater opportunities for
automation; 
- More accurate and shorter
delivery lead times.   Information systems: the Company's
computer and communications
architecture and key systems
function inefficiently, but are relatively
inexpensive and quick to fix: 
- Upgrades to the comms networks
and servers, combined with the
necessary firewalls and security
measures will take care of the
infrastructure;
- Much confusion has been caused
by the use of 5 different operating
systems and 3 different e-mail
platforms. One of each of these is
being upgraded and unified into a
single global solution and applied
uniformly throughout the group;
- Two incompatible releases of our
MRP and accounting system are
migrating onto the latest release of
the same software, which will
operate as a single, global system; 
- Executive Information Systems
(EIS): better use will be made of
existing EIS software.
Focus the organisation onto the needs
and concerns of our customers:
  Whatman's principal customers:
The most important, laboratories,
our traditional customers, are found
in academia, healthcare institutions,
pharmaceutical research  and the
biotechnology industry. OEM's
which use our specialist
membranes and lateral flow
technologies are becoming
increasingly important to our future.
Equally, the emerging demand for
the storage of nucleic acids is
creating a fast-growing range of
new customers for our unique FTA
technology.
  Whatman's brand and support:
This is strongest in the following
market segments:
- Analytical Chemistry: preparation
of non-cellular samples prior to
analysis, including environmental
applications;
- Diagnostics: diagnosis of human
and animal disease; sample
preparation/support for analytical
applications;
- Devices: filtration devices for
direct human contact, offering
protection from contaminants;
- Genomics and Proteomics:
manipulation and elucidation of
nucleic acids and proteins for
human and non-human applications;
- Genetic Identification: isolation of
nucleic acids for identifying
organisms and in the fields of
forensics, breeding and genetically
modified food.
  Our global business development
activities in these areas are being
driven by teams of highly skilled
professionals comprising
experienced business development,
marketing, technical support and
customer care specialists. 
  Applications-led marketing: in each
of the above markets, our sales
opportunities are determined by the
type and number of applications
which would benefit from the use of
a Whatman product (e.g. through
ease of use, output quality, cost or
productivity) - as compared with
solutions available from
competitors' products or services.
For example, in the forensic field of
offender data-basing, blood or
buccal samples are collected,
processed, analysed and stored. At
that point, the choice is between
storing and transporting a liquid
sample at minus 60 C (minus 80 F)
or an FTA card impregnated with
the same liquid - at room
temperature. The same thinking
now informs the selling proposition
for each of our products, replacing
the catalogue-based order-taking of
the past.
  Product line modernisation
programme is being kicked off in
2003, the first stage of which is
essentially product housekeeping,
with the cull of some 12,000 lines,
leaving circa 4,000 current SKU's.
To avoid disruption, this programme
is being rolled out through the sales
force, who are working with
customers affected by the changes
to ensure their comfort with the
new range. The improved focus
which results from this programme
allows Whatman to give customers
better technical support,
manufacturing consistency and
supply chain performance. Nor is
the task as difficult as it might
seem: at the start, 5% of our
catalogue numbers made up 80%
of our sales.
  Our sales forces are being reoriented
and retrained to address our target
markets and customers, using the
tools and techniques developed by
the business development teams.
The goal is to make the
representative a useful technical
resource for our customers, in their
quest for improvements in their own
operations. To enhance their
efficacy, our front line is supported
by technical marketing and
customer care teams. There are
three main sales forces - Full Line
Separations, OEM and Genetic I/D
- and these are being reinforced
and more effectively deployed
across North America, the EU,
Japan and the Pacific Rim.
The restructuring 
is on track. 
While there is much
to be done, the
planning has been
largely completed, and
the implementation
programmes will be
rolled out over 2003/4:
  Business Development organisation
- already complete and in place.
  Sales forces reconfiguration -
complete by quarter II, 2003.
  Manufacturing facility consolidation -
major sites complete by quarter I,
2004; small sites by quarter IV 2005.
  Office consolidation - complete by
quarter III, 2003.
  Information Technology -
infrastructure fix complete by quarter
III, 2003; standard desktop by
quarter II, 2003; MRP and
accounting information systems-
upgrade installed by quarter IV , 2003.
  Product Range rationalisation -
complete by quarter IV, 2003.
Taken as a whole, these restructuring
programmes will transform the way
Whatman operates, serve our customers
better, earn our shareholders'
continuing support, and make our
business a better place to work.
