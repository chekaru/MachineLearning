 review of tHe year 02
White Young Green plc annual report and accounts 2008
introduCtion
it gives me great pleasure 
to report another excellent 
year for white young green 
(wyg ) marked by strong 
double digit organic growth 
across primary skill 
groups and geographies. 
this organic growth 
was augmented by the 
contribution from three 
strategically important 
acquisitions and has placed 
the group in a positive 
position to deliver continued 
growth in the future.
finAnCiAL perforMAnCe
in the year to 30 June 2008, gross revenue 
increased by 28% to  282.1m (2007:  220.6m) 
of which  22.4m came from acquisitions completed 
in the course of the year. r evenue attributable 
to third parties, on which the group does 
not make a margin, increased to  50.0m 
(2007:  44.1m). as a result net revenue, which 
reflects the value of work done by WYG staff, 
increased by 32% to  232.1m (2007:  176.5m).

more than doubled over 
the past five years.
_2_WYG_ar08_front.indd   2 30/10/2008   08:59:46 Operating profit before the amortisation 
of acquired intangibles increased by 35% 
to  26.4m (2007:  19.6m). this increase 
included a contribution from acquisitions of 
 3.7m. Operating profit after amortisation 
of intangibles increased by 31% to  22.2m 
(2007:  16.9m). operating margin on net 
revenue was increased to 11.4% (2007: 11.1%) 
and the organic growth generated by the 
business in the year was 14%. 
earnings per share, adjusted to exclude 
amortisation of intangibles and the one-off 
reduction in the charge to taxation due to the 
benefit of prior year research and development 
tax credits, increased by 29% to 31.6p 
(2007: 24.5p). earnings per share has now 
more than doubled over the past five years. 
Basic earnings per share increased by 35% 
to 28.4p (2007: 21.0p).
Cash flow from trading improved 
significantly in the year . Cash generated 
from operations increased to  31.0m 
(2007:  11.4m) and represents 117% 
(2007: 58%) of operating profit. The focus 
on working capital management led to a 
further improvement in working capital days 
in the uk and ireland, which fell to 100 days 
(2007: 103 days), and an improvement in 
overall working capital days for the group, 
which fell to 96 days (2007: 99 days).
net debt at the year end was  68.2m 
(2007:  44.6m) with the increase resulting 
from cash payments of  29.5m in respect 
of initial and additional consideration 
on acquisitions. the group has banking 
facilities of  112m, which are secured 
until 2012. interest was covered 5.2 times 
(2007: 6.2 times) by operating profit before 
the amortisation of acquired intangibles. 
future prospects continue to be positive. 
the order book now stands at a record  400m 
(2007:  380m) of which 51% is represented 
by long term framework agreements extending 
beyond 2012. approximately 66% of the net 
revenue target for 2009 has been secured, 
together with 36% of the targeted revenue for 
2010. this puts the group in a strong position 
to continue to deliver consistent growth.
dividend
In view of the financial performance and 
prospects of the group, it is proposed that 
the final dividend is increased by 17% to 6.3p 
(2007: 5.4p) resulting in a total dividend for the 
year of 9.5p (2007: 8.3p), an annual increase 
of 14%. the dividend is covered 3.3 times 
(2007: 3.0 times) by adjusted earnings per 
share and 3.0 times (2007: 2.5 times) by basic 
earnings per share. The final dividend will be 
paid on 16 december 2008 to shareholders 
on the register at 3 october 2008.
strAteGY
during the year the group has developed 
and refined its Corporate Development Plan. 
the focus for growth in the future will be 
on three areas of activity: international 
diversification, energy and the environment 
and transport and infrastructure. of these 
areas, international diversification is seen 
as the primary objective at the present time. 
this has been achieved in p oland and in 
t urkey, which now offer a range of services 
which complement the core socio-economic 
consultancy and further international 
opportunities are currently being explored.

strAteGY Continued
the opportunity to develop by acquisition 
continues to be attractive and key areas 
and disciplines have been identified for future 
acquisitive growth. it is the combination of 
acquisitive and organic growth which will 
underpin the ongoing development of the 
business, together with the commitment 
to continue to deliver a high quality, 
client-focused service. 
Significant work has been undertaken in the 
year to improve the internal organisation of 
the group, streamlining operating activities, 
improving systems and devolving responsibility 
within a measured framework. progress has 
already been made in areas such as work 
winning, service delivery, working capital 
management and staff turnover. it is expected 
that this improvement will facilitate the 
achievement of the targeted level of organic 
growth for the business of in excess of 
10% per annum.
ACQuisitions
wyg completed three 
acquisitions in the first 
half of the financial year 
for an initial consideration 
of  34.4m. the combined 
revenue of these acquisitions 
on an annualised basis 
was  22.4m.
chairman's statement continued
t he businesses acquired were savell Bird & axon, 
which is a leading provider of high level 
transportation consultancy, management 
Consultants Group, which provides financial 
management consultancy to governments 
and public bodies in the international arena 
and pH mcCarthy, a leading provider 
of engineering services in i reland 
specialising in the infrastructure sector.
each of these acquisitions has been made in 
accordance with wyg's overall strategic aims. 
all have integrated well into the group and 
are delivering results in line with expectations.
acquisitions continue to be funded by 
a mixture of shares and cash. typically, 
the payment is split between initial and 
additional consideration. any additional 
consideration, which will be linked to the 
achievement of agreed performance targets, 
is paid in shares or cash at the discretion of 
WYG. In the last financial year all additional 
consideration has been paid in cash.
boArd
in January 2008 richard mcCaffrey resigned as 
Chief Operating Officer of the Company. I thank 
him for his valued contribution in developing 
the scale and reach of the business over the 
past seven years.
on 1 July 2008 paul Hamer joined wyg 
as Chief Operating Officer. I am delighted 
to welcome paul to the group. He has held 
senior positions in the contracting, oil, 
chemical and petrochemical industries and 
brings over 20 years' experience in business 
management, leadership and project delivery 
to wyg.
the focus for 
growth in the 
future will be 
on three areas 
of activity: 
international 
diversification, 
energy and the 
environment 
and transport 
and infrastructure.

the success of wyg 
is totally due to the 
engagement and 
commitment of over 
3,400 staff around the 
world. on behalf of the 
Board i thank all staff for 
their hard work and effort 
over the past year.
the group is determined to attract, develop 
and retain professional staff at all levels. 
the results of the recent wyg staff survey 
were encouraging, with over 91% of staff 
enjoying the work they do and over three 
quarters of staff saying they would 
recommend wyg to a friend as a good place 
to work. in the year the putting people first  
improvement initiative has seen increased 
investment in human resource support, 
an improved graduate development programme, 
the introduction of the learning academy  
to develop internal learning, the establishment 
of a new competency framework for structured 
career development and improved all round 
communication. the overall result is a business 
with a common set of values and aspirations 
which are clearly understood by all staff.
prospeCtive offer
on 20 June 2008, the group announced that 
it had received an unsolicited approach that 
may or may not have led to an offer being 
made for the entire issued share capital of the 
Company. On 13 August 2008, it was confirmed 
that discussions had ceased and the group was 
no longer in talks regarding a possible takeover.
whilst the approach was initially unsettling 
for employees, i would like to thank them 
all for their efforts in continuing to provide 
an excellent professional service to all clients. 
it is estimated that the one-off professional 
costs associated with the approach will be 
in the region of  300,000.
outLooK
although a number of the economic indicators 
in the uk and i reland remain uncertain, the 
outlook for wyg continues to be favourable.
the group has a broad client base spanning 
both the public and private sectors. it has 
a resilient, flexible workforce which can be 
directed at those market sectors generating 
the best opportunities and experiencing the 
most positive growth. initiatives are underway 
to streamline and improve operations in key 
areas such as business development, working 
capital management and cost control. in addition, 
the strategic focus on international diversification, 
energy and the environment and transport and 
infrastructure is already generating significant 
opportunity and the Board believes the 
combination of all these factors will provide 
a sound basis for continued progress.
