 fees of 1.8% and 3.5% respectively and, in the case of 
the chief executive of WPP Digital, a modest increase 
in his pension allowance to 15% of base salary and 
fees in order to align his position with that of other 
UK executives. Employees across the Group who were 
subject to a salary review received an average annual 
salary increase of approximately 3%. 
In drafting the Executive Remuneration Policy, 
we have maintained the structure of compensation as 
discussed extensively with share owners in 2012 and 
2013 and implemented in 2013. An addition for 2014 
is the inclusion of a recruitment policy, as set out in 
the new UK remuneration reporting regulations. 
This recruitment policy, found on page 144, has 
been drafted while taking into consideration input 
received from share owners last year. The policy 
represents a lower level of incentive opportunity 
than that provided to the incumbent Group chief 
executive, while seeking to retain the flexibility 
required to recruit talent of the level necessary 
to run such a complex global group. 
Pay for performance in 2013 
In 2013, the operational performance of the Group 
was strong, with like-for-like revenue growth of 3.5%, 
headline PBT growth of almost 11% and headline 
diluted earnings per share up over 10%. In addition, 
the last year has seen very strong share price growth 
and a considerable increase in TSR. The share price 
increased 55% from 888p at the end of 2012 to 
1,380p at the end of 2013, versus a 14% gain in the 
FTSE 100 from 5,898 to 6,749, reflecting a high level 
of investor confidence in the Group's future prospects. 
The annual bonuses awarded to the executive 
directors for 2013, of which 70% is based on 
financial performance, take into account not only 
the impressive performance of the Group but also 
the stretching targets set by the committee. The 
executive directors' bonus awards average 143% of 
target. Half of the annual bonus is paid in cash and 
Dear share owner
O
n behalf of the Compensation Committee, 
I am pleased to present the Compensation 
Committee Report for 2013. This year's 
Compensation Committee Report has been 
drafted with the new UK remuneration reporting 
regulations in mind. The Report therefore comprises 
three parts: my cover letter and summary of the 
key events that occurred in 2013, our Executive 
Remuneration Policy, and an Implementation 
Report. The latter two will be put to share owners 
at the forthcoming AGM for approval. 
Key changes in 2013
Following an extensive consultation program with our 
share owners during 2012 and 2013, we implemented 
a revised remuneration package for the Group chief 
executive, partly in 2012 and fully in 2013. At 
the beginning of 2013, the base salary and pension 
allowance of the Group chief executive were reduced 
in line with the amended policy, as was advised to 
share owners in the last Annual Report. A new 
long-term incentive plan, the Executive Performance 
Share Plan (EPSP), was approved by share owners at 
the 2013 AGM. The first awards under that plan were 
made in June 2013. These awards have a five-year 
performance period, with performance being assessed 
using stretching targets over TSR, EPS and ROE 
measures. These substantial revisions to our 
remuneration policy resulted in a materially increased 
level of support from our share owners and the 
advisory bodies, as demonstrated by the share owner 
vote in favour of the Compensation Committee report 
at the 2013 AGM.
In July 2013, we undertook the review of the pay 
packages of the Group financial director and the Chief 
executive of WPP Digital, whose pay packages were 
previously reviewed in January 2011. These 2013 
reviews resulted in modest increases to base salary and

the Compensation Committee half in deferred shares which vest in 2016, thereby 
reinforcing the alignment of the executive directors' 
interests with those of share owners. 
WPP was an early adopter of long-term incentives 
that measure performance over the longer five-year 
period. Each of the three LEAP plans and the 
replacement plan, the EPSP, are based upon a 
five-year performance period. In addition, 
participation in the LEAP plans has required 
executives to commit shares that could be matched, 
up to five times, dependent upon the Group's 
performance over the five-year period. The long-term 
incentive awards that were granted in 2009 under 
LEAP III vested in February 2014. The exceptional 
share price and relative TSR performance over the 
performance period of the 2009 LEAP award cycle 
has resulted in awards vesting at 87% of maximum. 
While the level of vesting will undoubtedly attract 
public attention, the close relationship between 
WPP's pay and performance is again demonstrated 
by the considerable value that has been created for 
share owners during that period. Indeed, over the 
five years from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 
2013, the share price increased by 243%, which 
translates to 28% per annum on a compound basis. 
WPP's TSR of more than 241%, averaged over six 
months at the start and end of the investment and 
performance period in accordance with the plan 
rules, ranks the Company in the top decile of the 
FTSE 100 over the same period. On the next page, 
I have set out some charts that illustrate the strong 
performance of the Company over the short and 
long-term.
Compensation and policy issues for 2014
There are no planned changes to the way in which 
the Executive Remuneration Policy will be 
implemented in 2014. For the executive directors, 
base salaries and fees will be unchanged as will 
annual bonus opportunity and EPSP award levels. 
The committee has undertaken its regular review of 
measures and has set new targets for the 2014 
annual bonus. The impact of the proposed merger 
between Publicis and Omnicom on the LEAP and 
EPSP TSR peer groups will be considered on 
completion of the transaction (a date for which is yet 
to be confirmed); details of the impact on the LEAP 
and EPSP comparator group and TSR calculation 
approach will be confirmed in next year's 
Compensation Committee Report. The nature of 
benefits provided in 2014 will also be unchanged, 
although the value may be higher or lower depending 
upon individual circumstances during the year. The 
fees for the current chairman and non-executive 
directors will also be unchanged.
Committee membership 2014
John Hood replaces me with effect from close of the 
AGM. He will chair a committee of engaged 
directors whose contributions have been constructive 
and supportive over the tenure of my chairmanship, 
especially those of Philip Lader and Esther Dyson, 
who are retiring from the committee.
John will also inherit the strong and able support 
of Mark Linaugh, chief talent officer, Derek Steptoe, 
worldwide compensation & benefits director, and the 
indefatigable Marie Capes, Company Secretary. 
Their professionalism and good humour makes for 
the smooth functioning of the committee and adds 
pleasure to the job of chairing it. I thank them all for 
their service.

The above graphs compare WPP's 20-year TSR performance relative to our primary peers and the major indices 
in both the US and Europe. Over this period, a  100 investment in January 1994 in WPP ADRs would be 
worth  1,940 in January 2014 and a  100 investment in January 1994 in WPP ordinary shares would be worth 
 1,898 in January 2014, with both investments out-performing our competitors and the local indices. An 
identical investment in either the S&P 500 or the FTSE 100 would be worth  518 or  413 respectively.
