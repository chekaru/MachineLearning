 Dear Shareholder
The Board welcomed the UK Corporate 
Governance Code when it was published 
three years ago and we implemented 
all its provisions. We particularly 
welcomed the Code's change of tone, 
signalling the importance of general 
principles in guiding boardroom 
behaviours and its continuing validation 
of the comply or explain  principle.
The new edition of the Code was 
published in September 2012 and applies 
to reporting periods beginning on or after 
1 October 2012. Despite this, we have 
incorporated some of the new provisions 
into this governance report.
I would like to highlight how each of the 
Code's main principles is being applied 
in practice. 
Leadership and effectiveness
Our areas of Board focus in 2012 are 
highlighted above. In the following pages 
we explain how we have been addressing 
them and the progress we have made.
Since my last report to you we have 
announced the retirements from the 
Board of Anthony Rabin and Robert 
Walvis and, most recently, the impending 
retirement of Ian Tyler.
Anthony retired after 17 years with 
the Group, 10 as a Director. He was 
instrumental in establishing Balfour Beatty 
Capital, now the Infrastructure Investments 
division and one of the Group's key 
value generators. Over the years he 
brought tremendous knowledge 
and experience to the Group and 
played a pivotal role in shaping 
our direction and growth and I thank him 
for his significant contribution.
Robert retired after 11 years on the Board, 
latterly as Senior Independent Director. 
He also chaired our Remuneration 
Committee for several years, during 
which he displayed independent 
leadership in the development of 
executive remuneration policy and its 
fair and consistent application. I thank him 
for his wise counsel and the contribution 
he has made to Board discussions. 
Through his tenure as a non-executive 
Director he brought robust challenge and 
critique to the Board's deliberations and 
provided an effective sounding board 
to me and the other Directors.
In January 2013 we announced that 
Ian Tyler would hand over to Andrew 
McNaughton as Chief Executive. On 
behalf of the Board and our shareholders, 
I want to say a huge thank you to Ian for 
his outstanding contribution during his 
16-year career with Balfour Beatty, 
including eight years as Chief Executive. 
It is testament to his leadership that 
Balfour Beatty has the depth of 
management talent to ensure a 
smooth succession.
To build on the strong platform that has 
been created and to lead the business 
through the next stage of its strategic 
development, the Board has made 
two appointments.
In July 2012 we named Maureen 
Kempston Darkes as a non-executive 
Director. With our increasing focus on 
market sectors and growth geographies, 
the considerable experience Maureen has 
already brought to Board discussions in 
these areas has added strength and depth 
as we enter our next phase of growth.
Finally, the Board is delighted that a leader 
of Andrew McNaughton's calibre has 
developed from within the business and is 
now ready to take over as Chief Executive. 
Andrew has a deep understanding of 
our customers and operations, and the 
relentless drive necessary to deliver 
the strategy that he has been intimately 
involved in developing.
Diversity
In 2011 the Board approved the 
development of a Group approach to 
diversity and inclusion. Our aim is to build

Remuneration
Over the coming few months the 
Remuneration Committee will be making 
its own assessment of whether the 
current remuneration policy and incentive 
arrangements remain appropriate as the 
Group evolves its business strategy and 
organisational structure. If the Committee 
believes changes are needed, we will 
begin formal consultation with major 
shareholders towards the end of 2013 in 
order to put proposals to all shareholders 
at the May 2014 AGM. We will report on 
the Committee's review findings in our 
next annual report, whether or not 
changes are thought necessary. 
Relations with shareholders
Among other stakeholders, engagement 
with our investors remains critically 
important. In 2012 it again received a 
considerable amount of attention. Further 
information on our investor relations 
programme is given on pages 79 and 80.
In last year's governance report, I said 
we were looking to increase the levels of 
shareholding among US investors, since 
a significant proportion of our overall 
business is conducted in the US or 
driven from the US headquarters of our 
Professional Services business. We also 
employ over 10,000 people in the US. 
I am very pleased to report that, as 
a consequence of our increased 
commitment of resources and time to 
investor communication in the US and 
through our ADR programme launched in 
July 2012, the percentage of our issued 
share capital held by US investors has 
grown from 15% to just over 18%.
Steve Marshall
Chairman
on the wide range of good practice in the 
organisation to stimulate further progress 
and recognition by sharing best practice 
and coordinating activity across the Group.
Recognising the compelling business case 
for promoting diversity in the Group, not 
only to help us reach into new markets but 
also to retain and attract talent, we have 
focused initially on gender diversity.
To move this forward in 2012, we 
appointed Andrew McNaughton as 
executive sponsor of activities to raise 
awareness of diversity, agreed a series of 
targets and reviewed our key policies and 
procedures. This review generated an 
integrated Group and divisional action plan 
and established a Group baseline analysis 
of diversity in the workforce and leadership.
A three-year diversity programme of 
action steps and publicly reported targets 
is included in our 2013-2015 sustainability 
roadmap. We have also reported the 
percentage of senior leadership posts held 
by women, the percentage of women in 
the workforce, the divisional diversity 
targets and actions achieved in 2012.
In the past year we have appointed our 
first female Board member and our first 
female managing director (in Balfour 
Beatty Living Places). We have launched a 
UK women's affinity network, Connecting 
Women, and received Bronze Awards 
from Opportunity Now and Race for 
Opportunity. We hope to build on these 
as we progress with the implementation 
of our action plan.
Accountability
We believe that the Company's policies 
and procedures enable the Board to 
present a balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Group's trading 
position and its prospects.
Through 2012 the Board continued to 
develop its thinking on the business 
strategy and model, and how the 
organisation can best be structured to 
achieve its growth ambitions in a trading 
environment that remains difficult. 
This work has crystallised into a clearly 
defined business strategy, explained 
in detail on pages 12 and 13 and pages 
16 to 23, focused on growth markets 
and the creation of a robust organisational 
structure which will be fully implemented 
during 2013. 
In 2012 we appointed 
our first female Board 
member and our first 
female managing 
director. We also 
launched a new UK 
women's affinity 
network and received 
Bronze Awards from 
Opportunity Now and 
Race for Opportunity.
