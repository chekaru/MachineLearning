    I am delighted that Berkeley is in 
a position to report these strong 
results which demonstrate the value 
of Berkeley's strategy and business 
model in all market conditions. In spite 
of the harsh trading environment, 
in which the value of underlying sales 
reservations was 52% below the historic 
average, Berkeley is reporting a pre-tax 
profi t of  120.4 million (2008:  194.3 
million). Operating margins are 17.8% 
and there have been no land write-downs. 
Berkeley ended the year with net cash 
of  284.8 million (April 2008: net debt 
of  4.5 million) as a result of strong cash 
generation from the business and the 
 49.6 million net proceeds from the 
share placing completed in March 2009.
  Berkeley is in tremendous shape, and 
now is the right time to implement the 
orderly succession of the Board and put 
in place the right structure for the Group 
for the future. 
 CORPORATE STRATEGY
  The announcement in February 2009 of 
the repositioning of Berkeley's strategy 
represents an evolution that is based on 
Berkeley's recognition that the UK residential 
property market is cyclical and the operating 
model must be fl exible and always aligned 
to the prevailing market conditions.
  This time last year Berkeley put forward 
proposals that were agreed by shareholders 
at the August 2008 AGM, to defer the fi nal 
payment of  3 per share until 2014 and 
use the funds to acquire land. What no one 
could have predicted at that time was the 
signifi cant worsening of the global banking 
crisis in September 2008 and the inevitable 
direct impact this had on the feel-good 
factor and mortgage availability; both 
critical to the housing market. For Berkeley 
and other developers this meant reduced 
visibility of future cash fl ow and profi t. 
For businesses more generally, it resulted 
in a fundamental reassessment of gearing 
and capital structures.
In light of these factors and in consultation 
with shareholders, Berkeley determined 
that it was no longer appropriate to both 
acquire new land and commit to return 
 3 per share to shareholders by January 
2014. As a consequence, in February 2009, 
Berkeley announced the repositioning of 
its strategy and a new capital structure to 
enable it to acquire new land and return 
to a more traditional dividend policy, with 
the commitment to return  3 per share 
by January 2014 no longer forming part 
of its strategy. Berkeley's shareholders 
demonstrated their support for this 
repositioned strategy by subscribing for 
6.0 million new shares in a placing that 
raised net proceeds of  49.6 million to 
ensure Berkeley has the right capital 
structure with which to embark on this 
next phase.
The placing of 6.0 million new shares 
increased Berkeley's issued share capital 
by 5%. A further 4.0 million new shares were 
issued in April 2009 on the vesting of the 
second tranche of shares under Element 1 
of the 2004(b) LTIP. Following these events, 
130.9 million shares were in issue at 30 April 
2009. The fi nal two tranches of Element 1 
of the 2004(b) LTIP (4.0 million shares each) 
are scheduled to vest in September 2009 and 
March 2010, respectively, at which point a 
total of 16.0 million shares will have vested 
under this scheme; the fi rst Element of 
which was satisfi ed in part through market 
purchases by the Company's Employee 
Benefi t Trust in the fi rst half of the year, 
with the amount represented by tax 
settled in cash. 
A further 5.3 million shares will vest in 
January 2014, as  3 options, under Part A 
of the 2009 LTIP, approved by shareholders 
at the April 2009 EGM. These options replace 
the 5.3 million shares that were outstanding 
under Element 2 of the 2004(b) LTIP. Part B 
of the 2009 LTIP is represented by options 
over 7.1 million shares with an exercise 
price of the higher of market value at the 
date of grant and  8.40 (being the price of 
the share placing completed in March 2009).
CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
STRATEGY REPOSITIONED 
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF 
MARKET CONDITIONS 
RESULTS
Berkeley is pleased to announce a pre-tax 
profi t of  120.4 million for the year ended 30 
April 2009. This is  73.9 million less than the 
 194.3 million reported last year, a decrease 
of 38.0%. Basic earnings per share are 71.3 
pence, a decrease of 37.6% on the 114.2 
pence reported last year.
Total equity (shareholders' funds) increased 
by  119.9 million to  801.3 million (April 2008: 
 681.4 million) and net assets per share by 
51 pence to 615 pence (April 2008: 564 pence). 
Return on Capital Employed for the year was 
20.6%, compared to 29.3% last year with 
Berkeley holding  284.8 million of net cash 
at 30 April 2009 (April 2008: Net debt of 
 4.5 million).
SUSTAINABILITY
Sustainability is an embedded part 
of the development process for Berkeley. 
It is a fundamental element of creating 
a high quality environment in which today's 
customers want to live their lives. Indeed, 
our focus on brownfi eld development 
and long-term investment in complex 
mixed-use projects refl ects our passion 
and commitment to creating a legacy of 
which we can be proud. We believe that 
this strategy has given Berkeley a defi nitive 
competitive advantage over our peers. This 
commitment has not been compromised by 
the current market conditions, as evidenced 
by our externally recognised industry-
leading position on sustainability. 
In April 2008, Berkeley was awarded the UK's 
prestigious Queen's Award for Enterprise: 
Sustainable Development. This award 
recognises companies which have made 
outstanding advances in performance or 
have a high level of continuous achievement 
in sustainable development. We were 
praised for our strong leadership, promoting 
best practice in the sector and embedding 
sustainability throughout the entire business 
operations. In addition, for the second 
year running, Berkeley ranked fi rst in the 
NextGeneration benchmark, a benchmark 
of the Top 20 UK homebuilders overseen 
by a high-profi le committee.

R&A PRINT.indb 02 R&A PRINT.indb   02 28/7/09 09:43:03 28/7/09   09:43:03 OUR PEOPLE AND BOARD CHANGES
All successful organisations must evolve 
and Berkeley believes that key to its own 
success is the nurturing and development 
of talent from within the organisation. Most 
importantly, the cultural values that have led 
to Berkeley's current position are embedded 
within the Group and its people. With the 
foundations well established and a new and 
exciting era beginning for Berkeley, now is 
the time to put in place the succession that 
has been carefully planned by the Board 
of Berkeley to ensure these fundamentals 
remain in place.
Following consultation with representatives 
from our major institutional shareholders, 
Berkeley has announced proposed changes 
to the Board which will become effective at 
the Annual General Meeting in September 
2009.  I will step down as Chairman and 
assume the role of deputy Chairman and 
as an independent Non-executive Director 
on the Board. After 33 years as Managing 
Director, Tony Pidgley will become Chairman 
of Berkeley and Rob Perrins, long identifi ed 
as Tony's successor, will become Managing 
Director. Rob has been with Berkeley for 
15 years; at one time Managing Director 
of Berkeley Homes and, since 2001, the 
Group's Finance Director. Joining the Board 
at the AGM will be Nick Simpkin and Karl 
Whiteman. Nick (39) has been with Berkeley 
since 2002 and has held a number of 
senior fi nance positions including Finance 
Director of St James. Currently Head of 
Finance for Berkeley, Nick will be the new 
Finance Director. Karl (44) joined Berkeley 
in 1996 and currently leads the largest 
Berkeley Homes division and chairs the 
Group's Sustainability and Health & Safety 
committees. He will join the Main Board 
as a Divisional Executive Director. 
The decision to appoint Tony Pidgley 
as Chairman from his current role as 
Managing Director takes into consideration 
the value to the Group of Tony's extensive 
experience and pre-eminent standing in the 
industry together with his understanding 
of the Group's culture and knowledge 
of the sector. The continuing and full 
time commitment of Tony to Berkeley is 
welcomed and will allow the business to 
deliver its repositioned strategy announced 
in February. The Board has also taken into 
consideration the need for the Chairman 
and Managing Director to be able to work 
closely and effectively and in Rob Perrins, 
the Board has a natural and the outstanding 
successor as Managing Director.
Following these changes, the Board 
will comprise a Chairman, fi ve Executive 
Directors and four Non-executive Directors. 
As a consequence Berkeley will look to 
appoint a fi fth Non-executive Director 
to achieve the balance envisaged by 
the Combined Code.
That Berkeley has performed so strongly 
in these market conditions is a refl ection 
of the qualities embedded within the 
experienced autonomous management 
teams that are Berkeley's foundation. 
Their determination to succeed and 
innovative approach to all challenges and 
opportunities is the driving force behind 
Berkeley's success. It is therefore extremely 
pleasing that Berkeley has been able to 
keep its key teams together and is using 
the opportunity presented by these market 
conditions to strengthen them wherever 
possible in readiness for the return to 
more normal market conditions.
 
On behalf of the Board and shareholders, 
we would like again to express our continued 
thanks and appreciation to all those at 
Berkeley for their outstanding contributions 
to the success of the business in these 
challenging times.
