Review of operations
During the past year the Company has focused 
on 	 larger 	 customer 	 contracts, 	 with 	 target 	 market	
businesses	of	25	to	1,000	employees,	which	
h a s 	 e n h a n c e d 	 o u r 	 a b i l i t y 	 t o 	 b e n e fi t 	 f r o m 	 s c a l e	
efficiencies	and	cross	selling.	F ollowing	a	
n u m b e r 	 o f 	 m u l t i - p r o d u c t , 	 m u l t i - s i t e 	 c o n t r a c t 	 w i n s	
during the year AdEPT Telecom is increasingly 
being recognised as one of the UK's leading 
c o m m u n i c a t i o n s 	 i n t e g r a t i o n 	 s p e c i a l i s t s , 	 w i t h 	 o v e r	
700 multi-site customers. Important customer 
wins during the year were Nationwide Autocentres 
with 	 216 	 sites, 	 and 	 a 	 further 	 120 	 sites 	 from 	 Rexel.
This strategy of targeting larger customers has 
continued and since the year end the Company 
has signed a new 36 month contract to supply 
a national electronic games operator with a 
voice	and	data	network	of	450	sites,	with	an	
estimated	contract	value	in	excess	of	 800,000.	
In addition AdEPT Telecom has been named 
by Ja.net (the Joint Academic Network) as one 
of only 20 companies approved to sell data 
products	to	Universities,	Colleges,	Higher	
Education and research establishments 
connected to the Ja.net network in the UK.
Our revenue is becoming more stable as we 
reduce our reliance on variable monthly call 
charges,	replacing	them	with	fixed	monthly	line	
rentals. The proportion of revenue derived from 
fixed	monthly	charges	now	represents	48%	
of total revenue (2009: 43%).
In an exceptionally tough economic climate 
during	the	last	twelve	months,	it	is	testament	
to the resilience of the business model and the 
skills of the directors and management team 
in place at AdEPT that the business has been 
successful in recording its seventh consecutive 
year on underlying EBITDA growth.
The	strong	cash	flow	 generation	continued	
during	the	year	with	 1.9m	of	free	cash	flow	
after interest. This was used to fund  0.3m of 
non-recurring costs and  1.6m net debt reduction. 
The Company ended the period with  1.6m lower 
net	borrowings,	which	at	March	2010	was	
 9.2m. Since the year end the Company has 
paid	down	a	further	 0.6m	of	debt,	reducing	
net debt at 30 June 2010 to  8.6m.
New products
AdEPT	was	originally	a	fixed-line	telecom	
provider but is increasingly expanding and 
diversifying its product range and has become 
one of the UK's leading communication 
integrators offering best of breed products 
from all major UK networks. 
A large number of data connectivity products 
were launched in the year including:
U  EB-SA - up to 2Mb assured 
symmetrical broadband
U Ethernet First Mile
U Direct Internet Access
U MPLS IP-VPN
A new range of 21st Century Network-based 
Inbound Call Handling products has enabled 
us	to	win	some	significant	call	centre	contracts.
Key suppliers
AdEPT provides products from the following 
tier-1 networks in the UK:
U BT U Kcom
U Virgin Business U Vodafone
U Cable and Wireless Worldwide U O2
U Opal (Carphone Warehouse) U Orange
U	 Griffin	 U T -Mobile
Cross selling of products
A key strategy for the Company remains to sell 
more products to new and existing customers. 
The product penetration has increased during 
the year: at March 2010 86% of revenue was 
generated from customers taking more than 
one product (2009: 81%).

Business review Corporate governance Financial statements
In the larger customer base (those spending 
more	than	 1,000	per	month)	we	have	seen	
further improvement in product penetration. 
At March 2010 customers taking more than 
one product accounted for 97% of revenue 
generated (2009: 94%). The proportion taking 
three or more products increased to 58% 
at March 2010 (2009: 45%).
Employees
The	improved	profitability	this	year	was	made	
possible by the continued hard work and focus 
of all employees at AdEPT Telecom. As a 
Company we are immensely proud of the track 
record we have created in a relatively short 
period of time and on behalf of the Board I 
would like to take this opportunity to thank 
all of our employees for their hard work.
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank 
the former directors and non-executive directors 
who stepped down during the year for their 
substantial contributions to AdEPT and to 
wish them all the best for the future.
Shareholder benefits scheme
The	AdEPT	shareholder	benefits	scheme	has	
continued to attract new members during the year. 
T h e 	 s c h e m e , 	 w h i c h 	 i s 	 a v a i l a b l e 	 t o 	 a l l 	 s h a r e h o l d e r s	
owning	a	minimum	of	1,000	shares,	provides	
eligible shareholders with free residential line 
rental worth approximately  120 per annum for 
as long as they remain eligible shareholders.
Outlook
The management actions taken in the prior year to 
reduce overheads and tighten credit management 
have enabled the Company to increase EBITDA 
levels despite top line pressure. The business 
focus for the coming year remains on continued 
development	of	organic	sales,	maintaining	
profitability 	 and 	 cash 	 flow 	 generation, 	 which 	 will 	
be used to reduce net borrowings. This has been 
demonstrated by the  0.6m net debt reduction 
already achieved since March 2010. We will 
therefore continue to grow our organic sales 
c h a n n e l s , 	 i n v e s t 	 i n 	 n e w 	 p r o d u c t s 	 a n d 	 c o m p l e m e n t	
this with continued investment in retention 
activities to retain more customers.
Despite the continued uncertainty of the economic 
o u t l o o k , 	 I 	 a m 	 c o n fi d e n t 	 t h a t 	 t h e 	 C o m p a n y 	 i s 	 i n 	 a	
much stronger position with its increasing ability to 
p r o v i d e 	 c o m p l e x 	 m u l t i - s i t e , 	 m u l t i - p r o d u c t 	 s o l u t i o n s	
to larger customers. This should provide more 
stability through longer customer contract durations 
and a more stable customer base. We will also 
continue to focus on our customer cash collection 
to ensure payment terms do not get extended.

The customer challenges
As	part	of	a	property	cost	and	other	overhead	cost	reductions,	
the customer wanted to divert all sales enquiries to a central call 
centre as an alternative to having sales function at each of their sites 
across the country. The customer required this to be done without 
having to change telephone numbers and thus not affect the customer 
experience. The solution was required to ensure that all inbound calls 
were	handled	and	routed	effectively ,	including	overflow	calls	to	a	
secondary location when the central call centre was at capacity. 
Combined	with	this,	the	customer	had	bespoke	head	office	and	
branch billing requirements along with monthly management 
reporting	to	ensure	efficient	estate	management.
The AdEPT Telecom solutions
U  Port the existing number into the  network' so that calls can be 
routed to a central location without the need to change numbers
U Provision of comprehensive and accurate management reports on calls
U	 Ability	to	redirect	calls	instantly	to	and	office	regardless	of	location
U  Named account management and project managers with specialist
