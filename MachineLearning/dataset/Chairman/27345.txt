CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
BUSINESS MODEL DRIVEN BY 
CAPTIVE CONSUMABLES AND 
OTHER RECURRING REVENUES
The headline figures for the year - orders of  44.6 million 
(2011:  44.5 million), revenues of  41.0 million (2011:  41.3 million) 
and after-tax profit of  4.0 million (2011:  3.9 million) were 
held back by the headwind we encountered in our defence 
business where, as previously announced, defence sales were 
 3.3 million less than in the previous year and defence orders 
were  5.5 million less than in 2011. Group orders excluding 
defence activities were  43.8 million (2011:  38.2 million), up 
15%. Similarly, Group revenues excluding defence activities 
were  40.0 million (2011:  37.0 million), up 8%. TRaC 
performed well during the year and the significant changes 
we have made to the Bio-contamination control (Bio-decon) 
division's business model are expected to have a significant 
effect on future results.
Service-related activities continue to be important to 
the Group, with service revenues totalling  25.2 million 
(2011:  24.4 million), representing 61% (2011: 59%) of 
consolidated revenues. Our export revenues are also 
significant representing 55% (2011: 57%) of Group revenues. 
In 2012 the Bio-decon division recorded orders of 
 27.0 million (2011:  29.6 million). (Orders excluding 
defence activities were  26.2 million (2011:  23.3 million).) 
Bio-decon revenues were  25.9 million (2011:  27 .7 million) 
- which represented 63% of the Group's revenues 
(2011: 67%). (Bio-decon revenues excluding defence 
activities were  24.9 million (2011:  23.4 million).)
Service-related revenues within the Bio-decon division 
were 39% (2011: 39%) and export-related revenues were 80% 
(2011: 77%) of the division's annual revenues. Customers in 
the Life Sciences sector represented 84% (2011: 74%) of the 
Bio-decon division's revenues. Currently the Life Sciences 
sector remains by far the largest contributor to the division's 
revenues, although we expect this to reduce over time as 
our Healthcare business grows. 
Defence orders were  0.8 million (2011:  6.3 million). 
Defence revenues were also substantially lower than the 
previous year at  1.0 million (2011:  4.3 million), reflecting 
the delivery schedules on our defence order book. 
TRaC had a good year with orders up 18% to  17.6 million 
(2011:  14.9 million) and revenues up 11% to  15.1 million 
(2011:  13.6 million).
The Bio-decon division's profitability was held back by 
lower levels of defence revenues and relatively subdued 
Life Sciences-related equipment sales into certain 
territories. In contrast TRaC's profitability continued 
to improve. Group profit before tax was  4.0 million 
(2011:  5.0 million).
Group earnings per share were up 3% at 9.6 pence 
(2011: 9.3 pence), reflecting a lower tax charge relating to our 
substantial expenditure on product development in the year 
of  3.8 million (2011:  2.0 million), representing 9% of Group 
and 15% of Bio-decon revenues, respectively.
The Group continues to have a strong balance sheet with 
net cash at the year end of  1.9 million (2011:  4.0 million) 
and net assets of  30.7 million (2011:  27.6 million).
Over the last few years we have set out to change the way 
we deliver our technology to our customers. Our business 
had become too dependent on capital expenditure-related 
hydrogen peroxide vapour (HPV) bio-decontamination 
equipment orders, with no other associated recurring 
revenues. In addition, our Defence business is  lumpy' 
leading to the profitability of the Group often being 
disproportionately affected by the results from our Defence 
activities. To counteract this in the Bio-decon division we 
aim to increase significantly the proportion of recurring or 
usage-based revenues. Following the investments we have 
made over the previous three years, in 2012 we launched 
a number of products and services which have been 
designed to increase the Bio-decon division's proportion 
of recurring revenues, including:
 launch of the ICE-pod which is a standalone room 
product for hospitals provided on a rental basis;
 launch of the highly innovative QUBE (incorporating 
captive peroxide consumables);
 launch of the IG-1 HPV equipment (incorporating 
captive consumables); 
 expansion of our range of hydrogen peroxide 
consumable cartridges; and
 launch of range of biological and chemical indicators 
(consumables, for use with our HPV equipment).
These products were launched at the end of 2012 and 
orders and revenues are beginning to increase. Demand 
for the ICE-pod has been particularly strong. We are in the 
process of re-configuring our business, which is likely to 
require some additional investment, to enable us to satisfy 
increasing UK and overseas demand. We anticipate that 
the ICE-pod will act as a conduit for our other HPV-related 
products and services.
The effect on Group revenue from these new products 
is not expected to be significant until the second half 
of the year. ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2012 Bioquell PLC

The Board believes that the market for Bioquell's 
products and services in the Healthcare sector should be 
substantially larger than the revenues that can be derived 
from the Life Sciences sector. We also know that Healthcare 
providers, particularly in the emerging markets, are 
experiencing significant challenges from the increasing 
antibiotic resistance of Gram-negative bacteria. The 
combination of our HPV technology and our new ICE-pod 
systems (which allow the creation of individual vapour-tight 
standalone rooms within existing open plan hospital wards) 
provides hospitals with an attractive range of solutions to 
help them combat the increasing and very real problems 
associated with drug-resistant bacteria.
We expect that the recent and well publicised difficulties 
associated with the provision of biologically-contaminated 
intravenous drugs in the USA, which has so far resulted in 
722 cases and 50 deaths, will emphasise the need for our 
new QUBE product which provides a low cost stand-alone 
work-station for use in pharmacies and was designed specifically 
for the preparation of intravenous and other medicines.
The TRaC division provides highly specialist testing, 
regulatory and compliance services to a broad range 
of UK-based clients. The majority of TRaC's revenues 
are generated from services which help clients satisfy 
regulatory requirements. We are also focussing TRaC's 
growth on markets & sectors where there are likely to 
be ongoing and increasingly onerous regulations.
Although TRaC's clients largely comprise UK companies, 
many of the larger customers - such as those in aerospace 
- end up exporting their products and as a result TRaC's 
business benefits from large export markets.
TRaC continues to invest in specialist test equipment 
in order to improve the service offering it provides to 
its clients and to differentiate itself from its competitors. 
Having invested substantially in its facilities over recent 
years TRaC is generating increasing amounts of cash from 
its activities. TRaC is also using the knowledge of its highly 
expert engineers to provide consultancy services to its 
clients, via its Early Stage Qualification (ESQ) business.
TRaC believes that there continue to be exciting opportunities 
for further growth in the United Kingdom. For example, there 
should be opportunities to expand and sell its services into 
the medical devices sector.
Your Board is recommending the payment of a final 
dividend of 3.06 pence per share (2011: 2.83 pence), 
representing an increase of 8%. The final dividend will 
be payable on 1 July, 2013 to shareholders on the register 
on 7 June, 2013. Bioquell PLC currently does not pay interim 
dividends and it is the Board's current intention only to 
propose the payment of a final dividend each year.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the Group's 
talented employees for their hard work during the year. 
PROSPECTS AND OUTLOOK
2012 was a challenging year for our Bio-decon division 
as we made major changes to our business model. These 
changes are now for the most part complete. We have 
launched a number of new products which benefit from 
captive consumable and other recurring revenues, and 
which are designed to increase significantly the quality 
of the Group's earnings as well as being margin enhancing 
in the future.
In 2013 the Bio-decon division is expected to increase 
substantially its revenues generated from the Healthcare 
sector - in large part as a result of strong demand for the 
ICE-pod which is requiring us to invest in and reconfigure 
parts of our business to enable us to satisfy demand. 
TRaC is well positioned for further growth and has started 
the year well.
The Group has a strong balance sheet and has the financial 
resources available to support high levels of organic 
growth, including for the ICE-pod which is a rental product.
