FINANCIAL ReVIeW
The year under review is the 12 
months to 31 January 2008 whilst 
the comparative period is the 
13 months to 31 January 2007, 
following a change of year end 
announced in January 2007.
Revenue for the year totalled 
 15.40m (2007:  15.95m) and 
gross profit was  4.89m (2007: 
 5.45m), a gross margin of 31.7% 
(2007: 34.2%).
The operating loss was  3.29m 
(2007:  1.58m). After an 
exceptional charge of  0.68m 
(2007:  0.42m) in connection 
with the closure of the Watford 
site, the loss before interest 
and tax totalled  3.97m (2007: 
 2.00m). With an interest charge 
of  0.29m (2007:  0.29m), 
the loss before and after tax 
amounted to  4.27m (2007: 
 2.30m). The basic loss per share 
was 2.2p (2007: 6.4p).
Adding back the exceptional 
charge of  0.68m (2007:  0.42m), 
the adjusted loss before tax was 
 3.59m (2007:  1.87m), and the 
adjusted loss per share was 1.9p 
(2007: 5.2p). The adjusted LBITDA 
amounted to  2.79m (2007:  1.15m).
At the year end, net debt totalled 
 3.9m (2007:  2.0m) and net 
assets were  0.1m (2007:  3.1m).
During the year, the Group 
undertook a further fundraising 
which resulted in a net injection 
of  1.1m from new and existing 
shareholders. Following the year  
end, in February 2008, to provide 
sufficient working capital to sustain 
future growth, the Group entered 
into an agreement with a specialist 
finance house, T otal Asset Finance, 
whereby the future revenues 
of the Jungheinrich European 
Inbound contract were factored 
for an immediate cash injection 
of  2.2m. In addition, the Group 
agreed amendments to its banking 
facilities with The Bank of Scotland.
no final dividend is proposed 
(2007: nil). 
BUSINeSS ReVIeW
In Night Division 
Occupancy levels of 
ParcelXchange reached new 
highs, 61% at the year-end 
compared to 51% last year, a 
remarkable achievement given 
no new exchanges were added 
during the year. There were also 
significant wins for our In Boot/ 
Direct Vendor Trunking service, 
allowing us to recover lost 
ground from previous years and 
ensuring Business Direct remains 
the no 1 company in the UK for 
In night deliveries. We have also

Chairman's Statement
reconfigured our route structure 
to provide a faster, more efficient 
service to our In night customers.
Specialist Division
This was a challenging year, as 
the new management team was 
forced to make difficult decisions 
in order to realise the potential of 
the Specialist Division. The closure 
of our Watford location led 
inevitably to some redundancies 
but, going forward, this decision 
ensures that significant annual 
cost savings can be achieved. The 
introduction of a new operational 
I.T. platform allows us to lead the 
field in offering scanning facilities 
to our customers, and gives 
greater visibility of profitability. A 
new, fit-for-purpose, vehicle fleet 
means we can give confidence to 
customers of our ability to deliver 
a professional, reliable and cost 
effective service.
ParcelXchange 
Worldwide Division
The concept of ParcelXchange 
Worldwide is that the Group 
leases, via a third party leasing 
company, its ParcelXchange 
technology to other In night 
providers and national Post  
Offices. It is hard to believe that 
this division was formed just 
over a year ago, in February 
2007, and we have been 
pleasantly surprised at the high 
level of interest from across the 
globe. In December, we won 
our first contract, to supply 
30 ParcelXchanges to DhL in 
Ireland, and the product is now 
being trialled by Post Offices and 
other In night providers across 
Europe and Asia.

Wilson and Martin Wright and 
the resignation of Derek O'neill

company. Richard was a non-
executive Advisor/Director of 
the Department of Transport's 
highways Agency Advisory 
Board from 2000 until 2005; is 
International President of the 
Chartered Institute of Logistics 
and Transport, having been its UK 
Chairman from 1998 to 2001 and 
UK President from 2001 to 2004; 
and was appointed CBE in 2004 for 
services to logistics and transport.
Also in July, Dr. Stephen Dakin 
resigned from the Board as a non-
executive director. I would like 
to take this opportunity to thank 
Stephen for his contribution since 
helping bring the Company to the 
AIM market in 2004.
eMPLOyeeS
The success of this business is 
reliant on the capabilities of its 
staff and I would like to express 
my thanks to the Group's 
employees for all the enthusiasm 
and commitment they have 
shown during a challenging year 
of much change.
As noted last year, the Group has 
introduced an employee sharesave 
scheme which gives employees 
the option of investing part of 
their earnings in a deposit account 
which can then, after three or five 
years, be converted into ordinary 
shares of the Company.
PROSPeCTS
Following the very extensive 
changes effected over the last 
year, I believe that the Group can 
expect to achieve the success it 
deserves. There are opportunities 
for profitable growth in all 
areas of our business and I am 
convinced that we now have 
the right people, systems and 
processes in place to see that 
growth will materialise.
