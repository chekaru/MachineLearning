Trading across our estate has been strong, reflecting the
positioning of our pubs in their local market places, our
successful preparation for the smoking ban, which has
had little impact, and the continued strength of the
London market as a whole. 
Our strategy remains the same with our intention being
to acquire high quality freehold, local pubs in London. 
We are financially strong and well funded. We believe
that whilst we are not totally immune to the challenges
facing the industry, our estate, being handpicked, will
outperform. Current trading is in line with the Board's
expectation and we are well prepared to take advantage
of opportunities for expansion when they arise.
Financial Results
These are the first annual results presented by the
Company since its adoption of International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and therefore figures,
presentation and terminology vary in some areas from
previous announcements. This document includes
reconciliations from UK GAAP to IFRS for the relevant
prior periods.
  Revenue increased to  18,828,000 from 
 14,221,000 for the same period last year,
representing a 32% increase
  Earnings before flotation costs, share options 
charge, interest, tax and depreciation increased 
to  4,485,000 from  3,695,000 last year, 
representing a 21% increase
I am pleased to report the results of the Company for the year to 29 March 2008.
Much progress has been achieved across our estate as we have continued to refurbish
and further improve our high quality portfolio of predominately freehold pubs in
London.We have also added six new pubs to the estate and disposed of three pubs 
for returns which have created value for our shareholders.

  Profit before tax, excluding the movements in fair
values of interest rate swaps, last year's flotation
costs and the results of property disposals, increased
to  1,898,000 from  1,502,000 last year, representing
a 26% increase 
  Under IFRS, the interest rate swaps taken out against
our borrowings require us to measure the fixed rate
swap against the prevailing rate in the market (ie mark
to market), at the period end. This has resulted in a
non-cash accounting charge of  1.06m.
  Underlying basic earnings per share (note 10)
increased by 31% in the period to 7.99p from 6.09p
  Gross investment of  13.3m in the acquisition of
predominantly freehold pubs completed in the period 
Dividend Policy
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 2.10p per
ordinary share (2007: 2.00p) making a total of 3.15p per
share for the year and representing a 5% increase on last
year. The dividend is subject to approval by Shareholders at
the Annual General Meeting to be held on 11 September
2008 and will be paid on 15 September 2008 to
Shareholders on the register of members as at 4 July 2008.
The Company intends to pursue a progressive dividend
policy in the future. 
Subject also to the approval of Shareholders at the
Annual General Meeting, the Company is proposing to
introduce an alternative scrip dividend which will give
Shareholders the opportunity to elect whether they wish
to receive the dividends in cash or in the form of new
ordinary shares in the Company. Details of the scrip
dividend alternative will be sent to the Shareholders in
the near future to allow them time to make their choice.
Corporate Strategy
The Company's aim is to continue to expand its number
of trading units and at the same time further improve the
performance of the existing estate. 
The Directors believe that the prospects for the Company
will continue to improve for the following reasons: 
  Over half of the existing estate of 24 pubs have 
been acquired within the last two years. Many of
these outlets have been substantially refurbished 
and are demonstrating significantly improved trade.
The refurbishment programme is now complete
  New agreements with our major suppliers came 
into effect in March 2008 and these will help to
continue to improve our gross profit margins

  Expanding the estate by acquiring new pubs at 
more advantageous prices which should generate
higher returns
  Head Office costs continuing to fall as a percentage
of sales
  Future cash generation will be used to finance 
new acquisitions
Balance sheet and funding
The Group's current debt is  30m, which represents
gearing of 92%.
The Board considers that the Group's level of interest
cover is prudent following  20m of its borrowings being
fixed for 10 years at an average interest rate including
bank margin of 6.3%. Repayments of these borrowings
will not commence until December 2009. 
Following the completion of its refurbishment programme,
the Group is increasingly cash generative and is supported
by strong trading freehold assets. Basic net asset value
per share is 165 pence and fully diluted net asset value
per share is 161 pence.

to 24 high turnover, predominantly freehold, pubs.

Board and Management
David Bruce, the Company's Chief Executive and Co-founder,
stood down from his current role on 23rd June to allow
him to spend more time on both his Charitable Trust and
his other entrepreneurial ventures. David has made an
immense contribution in helping to grow the Company and
played a key role in attracting investment from Shareholders
through the Company's Enterprise Investment Scheme.
He has been instrumental in helping to achieve the
Company's strategy of developing an independent London
portfolio of unbranded, predominantly freehold, pubs.
I am delighted to say that David has agreed to continue
as a Director of the Company in a non-executive role and
I would like to thank him for his huge commitment to 
the Company since its incorporation in December 2000.
Clive Watson, the Company's current Managing Director
and Co-founder, became the Company's Chief Executive
on 23rd June and his significant experience and skills will
enable him to continue to build on the Company's success.
David Kenyon, the Company's Finance Director and
Company Secretary, left the Company on 20th June 2008
in order to pursue a new career opportunity. The Board 
of Directors would like to record its appreciation to David
for his significant contribution and wishes him well in his
future endeavours. We will be announcing his successor
in due course.
The Company has a strong management team at Head
Office and highly professional and loyal staff working at
the pubs. These staff are the backbone of the Company
and have great passion for the business and its trading
style of operating unbranded free houses within the
London area.
Management agreement 
The Company has mutually agreed with The Capital Pub
Company 2 PLC (CPC2) that the management agreement
between the two companies should be terminated and
this will take effect from 31 August 2008. This will allow
the Company's management team to concentrate wholly
on building its own pub portfolio and will also allow 
CPC2 to plan its own strategy for the future. 
The management fee lost by the Company will be more
than offset by savings already made at Head Office and
the Board believes that this will help to improve the
quality of the Company's future earnings. 
Shareholder Information 
If Shareholders wish to keep up to date with news about
the Company, our website www.capitalpubcompany.com
includes details of our portfolio of pubs, corporate
information and promotional activity.
Current trading and outlook
Since the start of the financial year, trading has been
satisfactory and in line with the Board's expectations
demonstrating the quality of our trading estate. The London
pub market is holding up well and trading has benefited
from an increasing number of tourists coming to London. 
The Company is well placed to meet the challenges of
the current economic situation and more importantly to
take advantage when new opportunities for expansion
present themselves.
