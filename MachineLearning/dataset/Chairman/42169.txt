 R Review of the year The trading environment across our main markets remained difficult in the second half of
2011, as many economies tottered on the edge of recession and the Eurozone debt
crisis created global financial turbulence.  Oil and commodity prices did not ease as
anticipated, leaving input inflation well above expectations and consumer spending very
subdued.  Most of our markets in Western Europe have been subject to vigorous
government austerity measures, and falling consumer spending in real terms.
Net revenues saw a significant fall in the second half of 2011 to  7.8m (2010:  8.6m)
after a first half where revenue was level with the previous year. Overall revenue was
 15.6m for the year (2010:  16.5m) a drop of 5.5%, almost entirely accounted for by
reduced turnover at Sunline.  Operating margins have remained under pressure in all the
businesses, with our trading profit falling from  811,000 in 2010 (4.9% of turnover) to
 579,000 in 2011 (3.7% of turnover).  However, Group costs have shown a welcome
further reduction to  303,000 (2010:  344,000).
Profit after tax from continuing operations was  90,000 for the year compared to
 220,000 in 2010, with much of the variation accounted for by reducing operating
margins.  Within this figure a provision of  65,000 has been taken to reflect staff
reorganisation costs in Davies Odell's matting business at Kettering.  Earnings per share
on a basic and diluted basis, after accounting for non-controlling interests, are 0.20p
versus 2.10p in 2010.
Financial review Despite the decline in profitability during the year the Group generated cash from
operating activities of  939,000 (2010:  52,000).  Repayment of the acquisition bank
loans and the capital element of finance leases utilised  719,000 (2010:  694,000), net
capital expenditure was  111,000 (2010:  34,000) and interest charges were  146,000
(2010:  149,000).  This resulted in a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of
 75,000 (2010:  873,000).
The increase in the Group's invoice finance facilities over the period from  836,000 at the
end of 2010 to  1,151,000 at the current year end made possible the repayment of the
 500,000 acquisition bank loans that were outstanding at the beginning of 2011.  As a
result, net debt has been reduced to  2,206,000 (2010:  2,470,000) and gearing to 37%
(2010: 42%).
Operational review Davies Odell
Forcefield sales have continued to grow with continued new product and supply chain
investment and significant progress has been made in sales through new European
distributors.  In the UK, through our established dealer network, sales increased, despite
an overall 2.5% decline in the sales of new motorbikes and scooters.
Autumn 2011 was the first full season of ski/snowboard sales through retail outlets.  The
feedback is encouraging, with Forcefield products selling-through strongly.  Sales to this
market will not grow at the rate that motorcycle market sales probably will, but
demonstrate that with proper targeting, substantial winter sales can be developed
alongside our strong spring/summer profile.
Our shoe repair and factoring business has remained constant with turnover comparable
to the previous year.  The sheer variety of products and markets we supply here is
strength in a difficult trading environment.
Matting sales have been growing steadily, but operating margins have been falling for
some time.  At the close of 2011 we decided to reorganise to reduce overheads and
revitalise the business.  A substantial provision has been made for these changes, but
we expect to see renewed energy in product development and sales of matting.

Sales growth has been achieved in the year, with an overall 4.8% increase.  This has
been through the efforts of the team in Stockport to find both new designs to sell to
existing customers and probably more importantly by finding new export customers.
A second digital printer is now fully commissioned, enabling the business to undertake
larger volume bespoke orders.  New designs which fully capitalise upon this capability
have been presented to customers during the autumn trade shows and are beginning to
deliver volume orders.  Operating margins are broadly comparable with 2010.
Sunline
Sunline has had a difficult second half, after making good progress after the Redditch
closure in the first half.  The first half saw an 8.0% fall in turnover, but the second half has
seen a sharp fall of about 24.1%.  Direct mail volumes have declined due to rising mail
costs and the pressure on clients' marketing budgets.  The Redditch closure has been
well managed and its costs should be contained within the provision set up at the end
of 2010.  Overheads and finance costs have been contained within budget, and below
last year's levels.
D Dividend In the light of continuing economic uncertainty, the Board has decided that cash
conservation must remain a priority.  Consequently, a dividend is not proposed at this
time, but the situation will be kept under review.
The Board will seek at the Annual General Meeting to renew the following authorities that
were approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in 2011:
1. that the directors be given authority in accordance with section 551 of the
Companies Act 2006 (the  Act') to allot shares in the Company or grant rights to
subscribe for or to convert any security into shares in the Company up to an
aggregate nominal amount of  209,284.50; and
2. that the directors be given authority pursuant to section 570 of the Act to allot
equity securities (within the meaning of section 560 of the Act) for cash as if
section 561(1) of the Act did not apply to any such allotment, provided that this
power is limited to a pre-emptive issue and any other issue of equity securities for
cash up to an aggregate nominal amount of  200,000.00 (representing
approximately 37% of the present issued ordinary share capital).
The directors believe that these authorities would, for example, allow the Group to issue
new ordinary shares as consideration, in part or whole, for a suitable acquisition.
The Board considers that to limit its ability to issue shares, other than in strict proportion
to existing shareholders, to 5% of the present issue share capital would be unduly
restrictive.  Whilst there is no present intention of issuing shares, the Board considers that
the powers could be helpful and are not excessive in view of its investment strategy and
the present size of the Group.
The Board will also seek the power at the Annual General Meeting to make market
purchases (within the meaning of section 693(4) of the Act) of ordinary shares of 5 pence
each in the capital of the Company on such terms as the directors think fit, provided that
the maximum number of ordinary shares authorised to be purchased is limited to an
aggregate of 1,081,431 shares, representing 10% of the Company's present issued
ordinary capital, and subject to certain other conditions related to price.

People 2011 proved to be very challenging year indeed, with the beginnings of a double-dip
recession and continuing uncertainty across most consumer markets.  Our staff have
tirelessly confronted the business issues that have arisen and have entered 2012 with no
illusions as to the challenges ahead.  I thank them all for their application, persistence and
ingenuity in such trying circumstances.
Prospects As announced on 2 April 2012 CEPS acquired for  500,000 a 21.4% shareholding in a
new company set up to acquire 100% of CEM Group Limited (CEM Group ).  CEPS
financed this acquisition by the placing of 2,500,000 ordinary shares at 20p per share.
CEM Group is the holding company for CEM Press Limited, a business founded 40 years
ago which manufactures and distributes the sample booklets used in the marketing and
sale of household fabrics and wall coverings.
The total consideration for CEM Group Limited was  2.2m, the balance of the
transaction, including fees, being funded by loan notes of  460,000 and by  1.4m
provided by a number of private individuals.  The investment by these individuals was
made under the Enterprise Investment Scheme. 
It is the Board's intention over time, subject to price and availability, to increase the CEPS
shareholding.  In the meantime, CEPS will seek to identify similar opportunities in which
to invest.
It is encouraging to note that all of our businesses have traded at satisfactory levels in
the first quarter of 2012, and close to their respective budgets.
At Davies Odell, the restructuring at Kettering is complete, and there are signs that the
business has been unaffected by these upheavals.  Forcefield sales growth continues.
Overall our sales to shoe repair and manufacturing are meeting expectations.
Friedman's sales have exceeded the previous year throughout the first quarter and
currency exchange rates have also been more favourable during this period.
At Sunline a number of initiatives are in hand to improve the processes and efficiency of
our operations, given that margins are unlikely to improve.  We have appointed a new
Operations Director to oversee this change.  There is considerable work to do to ensure
adequate performance in 2012.
I remain cautious about the outlook for 2012 because none of the economic drivers
seem likely to give us any help, so any improvement will only flow from the actions of our
management teams.
