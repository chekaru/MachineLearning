 Review of the year After the positive start to the year, the second half's trading has proved every bit as
challenging as I feared.  The economy in the UK has once again hit  slow gear' and
across our consumer markets in Europe the position is, if anything, worse.  The
weakening of the Pound against both the Euro and the Dollar in the latter part of the year
has exerted downward margin pressure once again on many of our imported products.
Against this backdrop CEPS as a whole saw revenues fall by 3.6% to  15.1m (2011:  15.6m)
with the bulk of the decrease arising in the second half.  Courtesy of an outstanding
performance at Friedman's, operating profits for the year, pre impairment charge, are up
10.4% at  233,000 (2011:  211,000).  Group costs show a marginal increase to
 313,000 (2011:  303,000).  Overall this has resulted in a small increase in profit before
impairment charge and tax to  117,000 (2011:  90,000), though the success of
Friedman's has attracted a substantial tax charge, leaving a small post-tax profit of
 19,000, excluding impairment charge, (2011:  90,000) for the year as a whole.  The
loss per share on a basic and diluted basis, after accounting for non-controlling interests
and before impairment charge, is 0.53p compared to earnings per share of 0.20p in
2011.
Financial Review As a result of the annual review of the carrying value of goodwill we have made an
impairment provision against the goodwill attributable to Sunline of  2.5m the details of
which are set out below.  The impairment is not a cash item, is exceptional in nature and
has been included within administrative expenses.  It has the effect, when combined with
the trading performance explained above, of producing an operating loss of  2.3m, a
post-tax loss of  2.5m and a loss per share of 20.18p.  As discussed below, rigorous
plans have been implemented to improve the performance at Sunline. 
The historical trend for debt reduction has continued with net debt falling from  2.2m at
the end of 2011 to  1.8m.  Gearing, when calculated excluding the impact of the
impairment adjustment, is 29% (2011: 37%), but 48% when the adjustment is taken into
account.
In addition, due to the strong performance at Friedman's and the resulting cash
generation,  132,000 of 9% Guaranteed Loan Stock was repaid to the Company in
2012, leaving a balance to pay of  276,000.
During the year the Group generated cash from operating activities of  443,000
(2011:  939,000).  After net capital expenditure of  27,000 (2011:  111,000), the
investment in CEM Press Holdings that was made in April and financed by the placing of
2.5m new ordinary shares, the repayment of the capital element of finance leases of
 243,000 (2011:  219,000) and interest charges of  137,000 (2011:  146,000), cash
and cash equivalents increased marginally by  8,000 (2011: decrease of  75,000).
Operational review Davies Odell
Davies Odell continues to pursue the clear plan formulated some two years ago.  Sales
growth with the Forcefield brand continues apace (up 31.7% on 2011) with the addition
of new dealers in Europe and the USA, numerous well-engineered product launches and
successful entry into the snow/ski market via well-known UK retailers.  Sales of new
motorcycles and related apparel are down across Europe, but our sales continue to grow
strongly into 2013.
As ever some sectors of our shoe component sales are down and some up, but overall
sales are up about 4.9% on the year, with the leather heel unit assembly and Phillips
brand sales showing substantial increases.  Margins here have been under pressure of
late due to currency movements.  A new sales executive has been recruited to develop
further the potential in these niche markets, particularly with the buoyant UK men's shoe
manufacturers.

CEPS PLC
Chairman's Statement Our matting business has struggled to retain some of its better margin sales to the cow
and horse mat markets, whilst the low-margin business in both has been terminated.
Only the protection matting business has remained buoyant.  Overall, sales of these
products are down substantially.
Friedman's
Friedman's has had an outstanding year.  Its two digital printers and associated bespoke
design capability has enabled the company to increase sales by 11.0% to  3.7m (2011:
 3.3m) and to transform the margins it can generate.  Indeed sales growth accelerated
to an 11.7% increase on the previous year in the second half.  Overall EBITDA rose by
43.5% and the sales increase has carried over into 2013.
Sunline
In contrast to Friedman's, Sunline continues to suffer from the increasing fragmentation
and competitiveness of its core polywrapping and lettershop activities.  Sales fell for a
second year to  5.7m (2011:  6.4m) although the rate of decline was considerably less
in the second half.  There is overcapacity now in these markets and margins across them
are under severe pressure.  Sunline's are no exception with EBITDA more than halved to
 162,000 (2011:  403,000).
The direct mail market has evolved such that greater emphasis is now being placed on
electronic methods of communication rather than traditional paper based mailings.  Sales
and margins have been falling for two years and profitability has declined considerably.
This has resulted in the need for an impairment charge of  2.5m.
CEM Press
This is the first year that I have reported upon CEPS' minority involvement in C.E.M.
Press, in which CEPS acquired a 21.4% stake in April 2012.  Overall sales were in line
with budget for 2012 at  3.0m, but increasing margin pressures in the second half
substantially dented the budgeted EBITDA.  One source of this was the introduction of
increased production capacity by a competitor and associated price cutting.  Steps have
been taken in 2013 to restore margins by improving production efficiency.  In the financial
statements we have recognised our share of post-acquisition, post-tax profits of
 18,000.
Dividend Debt reduction remains a priority for the Group and a dividend is not proposed at this
stage.
The Board will seek at the Annual General Meeting to renew the following authorities that
were approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in 2012:
1. that the directors be given authority in accordance with section 551 of the
Companies Act 2006 (the  Act') to allot shares in the Company or grant rights to
subscribe for or to convert any security into shares in the Company up to an
aggregate nominal amount of  209,284.50; and
2. that the directors be given authority pursuant to section 570 of the Act to allot
equity securities (within the meaning of section 560 of the Act) for cash as if
section 561(1) of the Act did not apply to any such allotment, provided that this
power is limited to a pre-emptive issue and any other issue of equity securities for
cash up to an aggregate nominal amount of  200,000.00 (representing
approximately 37% of the present issued ordinary share capital).
The directors believe that these authorities would, for example, allow the Group to issue
new ordinary shares as consideration, in part or whole, for a suitable acquisition.

Chairman's Statement continued
The Board considers that to limit its ability to issue shares, other than in strict proportion
to existing shareholders, to 5% of the present issue share capital would be unduly
restrictive.  Whilst there is no present intention of issuing shares, the Board considers that
the powers could be helpful and are not excessive in view of its investment strategy and
the present size of the Group.
The Board will also seek the power at the Annual General Meeting to make market
purchases (within the meaning of section 693(4) of the Act) of ordinary shares of 5 pence
each in the capital of the Company on such terms as the directors think fit, provided that
the maximum number of ordinary shares authorised to be purchased is limited to an
aggregate of 1,081,431 shares, representing 10% of the Company's present issued
ordinary capital, and subject to certain other conditions related to price.
People The teams in all our businesses have continued to confront the substantial challenges
current trading presents.  The Board acknowledges their diligence and hard work in
these difficult circumstances and should like to thank them for their continued application
in 2012 and through into 2013.  Only our talented teams will find a way forward with
innovative new products and processes.
Prospects The priority for the Board is to ensure Sunline's fortunes are turned around.  At the heart
of this is the recognition that margins need to improve and that a combination of wage
reductions and productivity increases are expected to be the way the core polywrap
business will recover and flourish.  Action on both these fronts is well underway.  In
addition, the business recognises that it must find new, more profitable streams of
business that utilise the company's accumulated skills and knowledge.
The investment in Davies Odell's Forcefield brand is beginning to bear fruit, but we
continue to push for improved performance in this company.
Overall I remain very cautious about our trading prospects: we are only making
substantial progress where our products are highly innovative and market-changing.
