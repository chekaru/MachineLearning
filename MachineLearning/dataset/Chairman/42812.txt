The 	 outlook 	 for 	 polymer 	 prices 	 remains 	 unclear	
and 	 the 	 economic 	 recovery 	 in 	 the 	 markets	
we	serve	is	still	at	an	early	stage.	
However , 	 whilst 	 our 	 traditional 	 markets 	 will	
continue	to	be	challenging,	we	are	encouraged	
by 	 growth 	 in 	 higher 	 added 	 value 	 areas 	 which	
we	believe	offer	further	growth	opportunities.
