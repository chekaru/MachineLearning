 2 The Character Group plc annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 August 2006
CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
13093 11/12/06 Proof 14 13093
Introduction
I am delighted to report that, with the Group
now focussed on the business of Toys, Games
and Gifts, we have produced a very creditable
result reporting a pre-tax profit of  6.52 million
on the continuing business, compared to a
 0.66 million loss for the comparable period
last year.
Financials
The 2005/6 financial year has been one of
significant change for the Group both in terms
of structure and business focus; this follows the
successful disposal of our digital business in the
first half.
It is important that these financial results are
analysed on a continuing business basis as it
gives a much clearer view of what has been
achieved in the underlying core business.
Sales in the continuing business of Toys, Games
and Gifts in the year ended 31 August 2006
were  69.55 million, against  49.96 million in
the previous year, an increase of approximately
39.2%. Operating profit on the same basis was
 6.98 million versus a reported loss of  315,000
in 2005.
Group turnover, including the discontinued
business, amounted to  95.53 million (2005:
 98.79 million), whilst operating profit on the
same basis was  3.69 million (2005:  864,000).
Reported profit before tax in the period, after
an exceptional gain from the disposal of the
digital business, was  5.20 million against
 161,000 in the comparable period.
Basic earnings per share, on the continuing
business in the year under review were 8.49
pence (2005: loss of 1.69p). Allowing for the
discontinued business, overall earnings per
share were 5.93 pence (2005: loss of 0.39p).
The disposal of the Group's digital business
was completed in February 2006 and these
results include a contribution to Group sales
which amounted to  25.98 million, and
produced an operating loss for that business of
 3.29 million.
Overheads, as a percentage of sales for the
continuing business, were 31.8% (2005: 32.7%).
Stocks at the year-end for the continuing
business were some  5.4 million higher than at
the same time in 2005, and reflect the build up
of inventory to service higher anticipated
volumes for this Christmas selling season
(2006).
Cash at bank as at 31 August 2006 stood at  7.4
million compared to  10.3 million at the interim
stage and  3.7 million as at 31 August 2005.
The Group has operated comfortably within its
bank and trade finance facilities.
Dividend
The Directors are recommending an increased
final dividend of 1.65 pence per share. This
represents a 83.3% increase, which together
with the interim dividend of 1.65 pence per
share will make a total for the year of 3.30
pence and makes an increase in total dividend
of 65% over 2005.

CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT  CONTINUED
Subject to Shareholder approval at the Annual
General Meeting on 17 January 2007, the final
dividend will be paid to Shareholders on the
Register as at 5 January 2007 on 26 January
2007. The shares go ex-dividend on 3 January
2007.
Share Buy-Backs
The Group continues to investigate ways to
enhance shareholder value, whilst also looking
to widen share ownership and improve
liquidity.
During the year, the Company purchased
5,190,000 ordinary shares at a total cost of
 3,053,000, representing approximately 10.83%
of the issued share capital of the Company
(excluding shares held in Treasury) at 31
August 2006. Of these shares, 4,065,000 were
purchased for cancellation and the remaining
1,125,000 were purchased for and remain held
in Treasury.
It remains the Board's stated objective to
continue to enhance shareholder value
including, where appropriate, through
balancing the repurchase of the Company's
shares together with continuing to implement a
progressive dividend policy.
As at 31 August 2006, the Group had
47,923,909 ordinary shares in issue, excluding
the 1,125,000 ordinary shares held in Treasury.
Since the year end, the Group has purchased a
further 629,322 ordinary shares which are held
in Treasury.
The Board is proposing at the forthcoming
Annual General Meeting to ask for shareholder
approval to renew its authority to repurchase
shares in the Company of up to 25% of its
issued capital (excluding shares held in
Treasury).
Review of the On-going Toys, Games 
and Gifts Business
The year under review includes trading for
Christmas 2005, which was widely reported as
being another difficult one for the retail trade.
Against this background, the business has made
significant progress throughout the year.
The rate of sale of the early Doctor Who
products and the success of the Roboraptor
gave us our first real feel of the growth to
come, as well as indications from our Scooby
Doo, Gr8 Gear and other ranges which
altogether gave us confidence that our
investment in developing more of our own
products was indeed the right strategy for
growth.
We increased the depth and breadth of our
distribution throughout the year which also
resulted in an increase in our market share.

CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT  CONTINUED
13093 11/12/06 Proof 14 13093
Whilst the external indications of success are
often measured in increased sales and profits,
what is very satisfying to the Directors is the
progress made within the Company. During the
year, we have recognised the potential and
development of some of our key management
by appointments to the Board of our trading
subsidiary, Character Options:
l Paul Hillier Finance Director,
l Jerry Healey Marketing Director, and
l Steve Tull QA/QC Director.
In order to create a more efficient and
productive team we have also integrated the
UK development teams into one entity. These
changes and appointments have underpinned
the strength and depth of expertise within our
management team which in its new structure
has the capability to handle the growth
envisaged for this financial year and beyond.
Within the Far East, we appointed Michael
Hyde, a Chinese speaking American with
experience of both Toys and the Far East, as
Managing Director with responsibility for both
our Hong Kong and Shenzhen operations
which have been restructured into a more
efficient unit and will continue to provide
important QA/QC product development,
logistics management and customer support for
the Group as a whole.
We have also further developed our Character
on-line website (www.character-online.com). I
would recommend that you visit this site and
look at our current product line up, which I am
sure will give you a clearer picture of why the
Directors are confident of further growth.
People
I would like to take this opportunity to
welcome all those who joined us during the
year across the business. Also, on behalf of
Shareholders and the Board, I would like to
thank all our people for their hard work and
commitment, which has played a major part in
achieving this creditable result in the financial
year being reported.
Industry Recognition
During this calendar year, Character Options,
our principal trading subsidiary was awarded
Best Licensed Toy and The Innovation Award at
the 2006 Licensing Awards for its high
standards of technical achievement in relation
to its own-developed Doctor Who Radio
Controlled Dalek.
In addition, in the recent Top 60 listings for
Christmas 2006, Character achieved six items
within the six categories.
Robosapien V2 was voted Toy of the Year by
Duracell.

CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT  CONTINUED
The Company has also been awarded the
Certificate of Excellence Bronze award for the
Group's own-developed Peppa Pig Playhouse
by the Practical Pre-School Foundation.
Recently, we were also recognised for our high
level of service by Toys R Us, one of our major
customers. This was especially pleasing as it is
awarded for all aspects of trading including
product offering through to quality control,
efficiency of administration, logistics as well as
marketing and this award clearly demonstrates
the continued improvement in our overall
performance.
Current Trading
As our product offering has continued to
strengthen, we have simultaneously widened
our distribution base and achieved improved
penetration for our major product categories at
retail.
Sales for our Toys and Games have achieved
record levels for the first quarter of the new
financial year, with growth coming from across
virtually all our major categories.
At the retail level, we have also seen substantial
growth in both sales and market share in the
UK, with no less than three out of the toy
industry's top ten best selling toys at retail in
October having been designed and developed
by Character in-house.
We expect that by Christmas 2006, we shall
have seen solid double digit growth in all our
major product categories with the exception of
Robotics where it will be hard to beat last
year's outstanding record sales.
We have continued to improve our global
trading relationships and look forward to seeing
increased international sales going forward.
Looking Forward
At this stage of the year, we have already
established our product line-up for 2007
calendar year and commenced previewing our
full ranges with our major customers.
Our strategy going forward is to continue the
development of our major product categories
which include:
l Doctor Who
l Biker Mice from Mars
l Scooby Doo
l Robotics
l Disney Princess
l Peppa Pig
l Gr8 Gear
l Gr8 Art
l Games
l Gloe plush
l Novelty Pens

CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT  CONTINUED
13093 11/12/06 Proof 14 13093
We are also introducing new product categories
such as Supermag, Spiderman 3, Bindeez,
Planet Earth, Barney and Disney Racing.
Additional categories are under discussion and
will be announced at the appropriate time.
It continues to be our strategy both to develop
our own products as well as seek exciting
products for distribution.
Prospects
The new financial year has started very well,
with Toys and Games sales in the all important
run up to Christmas not only exceeding our
earlier expectations but at record levels.
It is very encouraging to see the strong growth
across many of our major product categories as
they are becoming more established. The
trade's response to our new products for 2007
has again been very robust and these factors
create a strong base from which to continue to
grow both our sales and market share.
The Directors are confident that 2007 will be
another good year of growth for the Group.
