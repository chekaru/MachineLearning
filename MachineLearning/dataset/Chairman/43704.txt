CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2006 
______________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
It gives me great pleasure to report on Cheerful Scout's progress and I believe your Company has much to 
celebrate in its tenth year. The period under review has been extremely positive resulting in an exciting turnaround 
in our core business of corporate programming and DVD production. Several prestigious awards have been won - 
CIB and IVCA in UK and recently at the FEIFA Grand Prix awards in Vienna, which underline our commitment to 
quality and the use of innovation and further solidify our position and reputation in our market place. Importantly, we 
have strengthened our portfolio of blue-chip clients, secured a solid pipeline of new business and enhanced our 
technology and service offering - primarily through the launch of nVision. I therefore believe we have a healthy 
business that will now be in a position to deliver value to shareholders and realise our full potential. 
 
Financial Results 
 
As confirmation of our improvement and ongoing success, I am delighted to report an inaugural pre-tax profit of 
 259,032 before goodwill amortisation and reorganisation costs (2005: loss  219,865 before goodwill amortisation 
and impairment) on a turnover of  2,173,163 (2005:  898,492).Cash balances stand at  885,559. We are 
encouraged that our existing core business has made the most significant impact on the numbers and as we 
anticipate an increased potential contribution from our new divisions - we can look forward to the future with keen 
anticipation. 
No Dividend will be payable this year, but the Directors will continue to review this position closely as our financial 
situation improves. 
 
Operations 
 
Cheerful Scout is a multidisciplinary creative consultancy that specialises in devising and delivering corporate 
communications solutions. Its business is divided into three areas; (1) film and video programme production; (2) 
DVD Authoring; (3) nVision Technology - which incorporates the events division. 
 
(1) Programme Production 
The programme productions division - which builds entire projects from initial ideas through to implementation - 
continues to perform well. While much of our work has traditionally been from long standing contracts with clients 
such as Allen & Overy and Deloitte, we have now secured a number of new contracts with other leading 
organisations. In particular we recently won two branding contracts, the first a project with the Health, Work and 
Wellbeing Strategy Department and the second a project to create the imagery and characters for the new Tesco 
Direct service. This increase in client base not only bodes well for the future but underlines that our attention to 
detail, creativity and quality of work is paying off, as new business increases from both old and new clients. 
 
(2) DVD 
In the same vein, our DVD division is also performing well.  We have been an active participator in the DVD market 
for several years and have worked on a number of major features as well as many well known television series such 
as Spooks and Life On Mars.  Our customers recognise our consistently high standard of work, enabling us to build  
an extensive and loyal customer base which includes 2 Entertain, Contender Entertainment Group and Fremantle. 
This high standard has once again been endorsed by our DVD department being singled out by Televisual for its 
menu designs as some of the best for 2006. 
 
(3) nVision 
Cheerful Scout is building a name for itself as a developer of pioneering technologies and for pushing the 
boundaries of on-screen visual communication. 
nVision technology is our latest development, of which there are two versions: nVision Presenter, a unique 
communications product targeted at organisers of live events, and nVision Strategy, a high end product directed at 
organisations requiring complex problem solving tools. 
nVision Presenter was the first to launch in 2006 and is establishing itself in the market place. With such a unique 
offering, we decided that your Company could increase the business potential and benefits of nVision Presenter by 
establishing an events division to help organise and execute live events. We have subsequently organised a number 
of events both in the UK and in Europe which I am happy to report, were very well received.  
 
The Business Intelligence Market is growing rapidly and I am delighted that nVision Strategy provides an entry point 
into what is an entirely new market for Cheerful Scout. We believe that nVision Strategy will provide considerable 
opportunities for us in the future. Furthermore, to develop the product further, we are co developing with a  
visualisation company that deals in strategy for large retail corporates. We believe by working with partners we can 
increase both the value of our proposition as well as the uptake.  CHEERFUL SCOUT PLC

CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT (CONTINUED) 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2006 
______________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
Our People  
 
Our people are crucial to the success of Cheerful Scout. We have 18 full time people all who are well trained, able to 
adapt to the changing needs of our clients and who understand the Cheerful Scout ethos. The culture of Cheerful 
Scout remains as solid today as it did when it was founded by Gary and Peter 10 years ago. It remains flexible, 
innovative and creative and offers the best service possible at all times to all clients. We understand the importance 
of client relationships and will continue to employ and hopefully retain the very best of people. 
 
We are proud of our retention of staff, which I believe can be put down to the management, innovative environment 
and the opportunities for those involved in the business as we continue to grow. Good people are essential and I'd 
like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for their hard work in building Cheerful Scout to what it is today.  
 
Consolidation of Share Capital 
 
Your Board is aware that, due to the large number of shares in issue and low unit price per share, the Company's 
shares have traded with a relatively wide bid-offer spread compared to other companies of similar size. Your Board 
believes that consolidating the share capital of the Company will reduce trading costs for shareholders without 
having an adverse effect on liquidity, and will result in a more appropriate number of shares in issue. 
 
Consequently, your approval is sought for a consolidation of the ordinary shares of 0.5p each, such that all 
shareholders will receive one new ordinary share of 12.5p each for every 25 ordinary shares of 0.5p.  Subject to the 
passing of resolution 6 of the notice of the AGM, fractions of new ordinary shares resulting from the consolidation 
will not be issued to shareholders.  The Board may decide that any fractions shall be consolidated into consolidated 
shares which the Board may sell for the best price that can be reasonably obtained.  The net proceeds of any such 
sale after deduction of expenses will be distributed in due proportion among holders of fractional entitlements 
(except that any amount due which is less than  3 may be retained for the benefit of the Company).  Based on the 
shareholdings at the date of this letter, it is not expected that any fractional entitlements will be above  3 and so it is 
not expected that any distribution will be made to shareholders in relation to fractional entitlements. 
 
Except in relation to fractional entitlements, the proportion of each shareholder's interest in the Company will remain 
the same, and except for the increase in nominal value, the new ordinary shares will be identical in all respects to 
the ordinary shares. The new ordinary shares will rank pari passu in respect of dividends. 
 
As a result of the consolidation of ordinary shares the existing warrants to subscribe for ordinary shares will also be 
consolidated such that each consolidated warrant would entitle the holder to subscribe for one new ordinary share of 
12.5 p at 62.5 p per share. 
 
The record date for the consolidation of both the ordinary shares and the warrants is close of business on 23 
November 2006. Crest accounts will be credited with new ordinary shares and/or new warrants in uncertificated form 
on 24 November 2006.  Dealings will commence in new ordinary shares and new warrants on 24 November 2006.  
Persons holding ordinary shares and warrants in certificated form will be issued with new share certificates and new 
warrant certificates on 7 December 2006. Existing share certificates and warrant certificates will remain valid 
pending the issue of new share certificates and new warrant certificates. Upon receipt of new share certificates and 
new warrant certificates, the existing share certificates and warrant certificates will become invalid and should be 
destroyed. 
 
Outlook 
 
As the results demonstrate, our previous investment in both technology and a highly experienced team has enabled 
us to build a strong position in a competitive market. I am confident that our success will continue and that the future 
stability and growth of the Company is in safe hands. Importantly, our core business and nVision are beginning to 
interact, creating new business prospects for each other, thus further strengthening our investment case. Through 
leveraging the team's creative abilities and exploiting our unique technology, we have created a solid platform from 
which to further develop the business and in turn generate increased shareholder value and fulfil the potential of 
what I believe to be a very exciting company.
