 2 Annual Report & Accounts 2002
This is the ninth set of full year results since joining the Stock
Market in 1994. For eight years we achieved consecutive
double digit growth in operating profits. In 2002 we have
experienced a major setback with a decline in headline
operating profits of over 50%. I will go into the reasons for
this at some length in the next section.
Operating income in 2002 decreased by 26% to  70.4 million
( 95.1 million) and operating profit (prior to exceptional
costs and goodwill amortisation and impairment) by 53% 
to  8.4 million ( 17.8 million).
Because our income declined we had to cut costs which we
did by 20% from  77.3 million to  62 million. The result of
this reduction in cash in and increase in cash out to pay 
for enforced redundancies meant that we breached our
banking covenants. 
However I am pleased to tell you that we have entered into
a new 3-year committed facility with our bank, Royal Bank 
of Scotland. (The new arrangements are detailed in the
Finance Director's statement.)
The effect of this very poor year is that headline profit 
before tax decreased by 57% to  7.0 million ( 16.3 million)
and headline earnings per share decreased by 58% to 3.2p.
These figures are both prior to exceptional costs and
goodwill amortisation and impairment. Exceptional costs 
are  12.6 million resulting in a loss before tax and 
goodwill amortisation and impairment of  5.6 million.
Goodwill amortisation and impairment was  36.0 million
resulting in a loss before tax of  41.6 million.
Exceptional costs and goodwill amortisation and impairment
are detailed at some length in the Finance Director's statement.
Reasons for the fall in operating profits
From mid 2001 right through to the end of 2002 we have
seen major reductions in marketing and communication
expenditure. In effect, an 18-month recession in our
marketplace. This has seen a number of constant features:
 Budget cuts
 Pressure on our income through fee and commission cuts
  Cancellation and postponements of projects
 Switching from retainer to project-based relationships
 Switching from fees to time costs
  An increase in pitching and re-pitching with the attendant
non-recoverable costs
  Regular downsizing of the workforce with all the
attendant short term cost disadvantages
 A reduction in occupied space with the attendant cost
provision.
These pressures on income, costs and profit have been right
across the entire range of services we offer, all forms of public
relations, advertising and marketing services. The only
exception has been research.
In detail, we have been hit by some clearly identifiable
marketplace factors:
  The absence of major M&A activity
 A major reduction in flotation activity
 A heavy reduction in corporate activity and reputation
management in reaction to low corporate profitability
 A reduction in consumer marketing despite the continued
growth in consumer spending. Marketing has been carried
out primarily by cutting prices to the consumer
 A heavy reduction in financial services marketing as the
brands in this sector have been hit by stock market falls
and the pensions crisis
In spite of all this gloom 
we have seen real profit 
growth in a number of our
businesses, mainly as a
result of our continuing
restructuring and
refreshment of our offerings
Chairman's statement
Lord Bell, Chairman 3
 A virtual collapse of the hi-tech sector as dot.coms
disappeared and major hi-tech brands retrenched into
minimal marketing activity to offset profit declines and
balance sheet problems
  In addition to all this our advertising business has been
very hard hit, not just because of the market downturn
but also the loss of major clients through change of client
management, international realignment and changes of
fashion. HHCL lost its place as the UK top hotshop to
Mother, and Roose's position as the agency for non-aligned
multi national brands diminished as the clients changed
their policy on alignment.
Some bright spots
In spite of all this gloom we have seen real profit growth in a
number of our businesses, mainly as a result of our continuing
restructuring and refreshment of our offerings.
  Bell Pottinger Public Affairs where we brought in 
a new managing director is now the leading brand 
in the sector
 Opinion Leader Research where the founders have returned
and re-established the business as the pre-eminent
qualitative and consultative research brand
  Harvard Health where we merged our two different brands
and have seen real growth in the business
  Bell Pottinger Public Relations where we restructured the
management we have seen a change from loss to a profit
of nearly  0.75 million
  Our contract publishing business, AMD Brass Tacks 
has also increased profits with a strengthened
management team.
Other bright spots have been at AMD Online, our website
design business which continued to prosper despite the
massive downturn in the sector, and Pure Media where our
specialist media buying service has prospered against the
reduction in media spend.
Overall, all our brands, despite the difficulties chronicled
above, are strong and resilient and well able to capitalise 
on the eventual return to growth in the marketplace.
The results by sector are as follows (all operating profit figures
are shown prior to exceptional costs, goodwill amortisation
and impairment):
Public relations
Operating income in 2002 was  28.5 million 
(  36.2 million in 2001) and operating profit was 
 3.7 million ( 7.0 million in 2001). The margin was 
12.8% compared to 19.4% in 2001.
Our public relations businesses continue to be the largest part
of our Group contributing 40% of the operating income and
43% of the operating profit in 2002.
Hi-tech
Operating income in 2002 was  8.9 million ( 16.3 million in
2001) and operating profit was  0.7 million ( 2.8 million in
2001). The margin was 8.3% compared to 16.8% in 2001.
Despite the difficult trading
conditions the Group has
continued to win major new
clients and be involved in
high profile marketing and
communications activities
Marketing services/Research
Operating income was  11.0 million ( 10.5 million in 2001)
and operating profit was  1.3 million ( 0.7 million in 2001).
The margin was 12.3% compared to 6.5% in 2001.
Advertising
Operating income was  22.0 million ( 32.1 million in 2001)
and operating profit was  2.7 million ( 7.3 million in 2001).
The margin was 12.2% compared to 22.9% in 2001.
The Group has sold 49% of HHCL & Partners to WPP and
going forward the remaining investment in HHCL will be
accounted for on an associate basis and not included in the
segmental analysis. Operating income in 2002 for HHCL was
 8.6 million ( 16.6 million in 2001) and operating profit was
 0.4 million ( 2.5 million in 2001).
Excluding HHCL, advertising represented 22% of Group
operating income and 28% of operating profit.
Business activity
Despite the difficult trading conditions the Group has
continued to win major new clients and be involved in
high-profile marketing and communications activities.
The Group acted for 1,085 clients in 2002 compared to 1,148
in 2001, 168 (127 in 2001) of our clients used more than one
of our brands and 33 (30 in 2001) clients used more than two
of our brands. Average fee per client has decreased from
 83,000 in 2001 to  65,000 in 2002 ( 69,000 in 2000).
155 clients each paid over  100,000, compared to 195 in 2001.
The difficult trading conditions, oversupply in the marketplace
and continued pressure from clients to reduce costs, has 
put downward pressure on fees which is reflected in the
above statistics.
Chairman's statement 3 4 Annual Report & Accounts 2002
Corporate activity
In February 2003 the Group sold 49% of HHCL & Partners Ltd
to WPP Group (UK) Limited for  3.5 million in cash. HHCL has
become part of the international Red Cell Group owned by
WPP. Further consideration of up to  0.5 million will be
payable in cash provided HHCL achieves operating trading
income of at least  8 million in 2003. In addition, Chime has
the right to sell its remaining interest in HHCL to WPP after
1 January 2004. Under the terms of the agreement WPP will
have day-to-day management control of HHCL.
In March 2003 the Group completed the purchase of the
remaining 40% of Pure Media Group Limited (Media Buying
Agency) which it did not already own. The consideration 
was  600,000 in bank guaranteed loan notes,  300,000 in
non-guaranteed loan notes and the issue of 2.6 million shares.
Looking ahead
The first quarter of 2003 appears to be no worse than the
last quarter of 2002 and we think this may be an indication
that the declines in operating income experienced in the
second half of 2001 and throughout 2002 have now stopped.
However there are no signs so far that anything is getting
much better.
Some of our businesses are growing - particularly those in
research, consumer public relations and public affairs, but
overall performance appears to be flat. We continue to bear
down very heavily on costs.
There remains a lack of visibility. The present economic
conditions and the war lead us to believe that there will be
no recovery in 2003. If operating income starts to decline
further at any point in 2003 we will take quick action to
reduce costs. We have continued to win clients in 2003 
and major wins so far have included Wal*Mart in its
potential bid for Safeway, BAE Systems, 0 2, Wedgwood 
and Madame Tussauds.
Our staff have continued to be very supportive through what
has been the most difficult year in our history and I am
grateful for their hard work and support.
We now have the Company on a sound financial footing and
we are well positioned to respond to any upturn in the
marketplace when it happens.
