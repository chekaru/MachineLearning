 CHINA FOOD COMPANY PLC (formerly VESTPA PLC)

CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
Overview
On 10 December 2007, following shareholders approval, Vestpa Plc (Vestpa ) successfully completed its reverse acquisition 
of Full Fortune Holdings Pte. Limited (Full Fortune ), together with its subsidiaries (the Full Fortune Group ), following which 
its core business became the manufacture and distribution of animal feed and condiments products in the Shandong province 
of the People's Republic of China (the PRC ). Refl ecting this change in principal activity, and successful implementation of its 
investing strategy, the Company aptly, renamed itself as China Food Company Plc (China Food ).
The Full Fortune Group was acquired for a consideration of approximately  25.2 million, which equated to an historic price 
to earnings multiple of approximately 5.7 times. The consideration was satisfi ed through the issuance of 40,333,333 new 
ordinary shares in Vestpa Plc and a cash payment of  5 million.  As a consequence, the vendors of the Full Fortune Group 
became the majority shareholders of the Company. In accordance with the reverse acquisition accounting policy adopted by 
the Company (further details of which are set out in Note 3.1 (a) below), the fi nancial statements include the results of Full 
Fortune and its subsidiaries, as if it were the acquirer, for the entire twelve month period and the results of China Food, as if it 
were the acquired company, from 10 December 2007 to 31 December 2007.
The Group produces a range of products under Full Fortune's Fushi  and Fushi Hao Tai Tai  brand names from its current 
28,294 square metre factory site in Weifang City with a total built-up area of approximately 17,663 square metres.  The Group 
has land use rights covering an area of 199,657 square metres for new premises in Shou Guang City and a new manufacturing 
facility for the Company is currently in the course of construction. This new plant will increase production capacity for the 
Group's condiment products by 50 per cent. from 100,000 to 150,000 tonnes per annum and is expected to be completed and 
commissioned during the second half of the current fi nancial year.
China Food operates in one of the fastest growing segments within the PRC's food industry refl ecting the increasing purchasing 
power of Chinese consumers. Annual sales for this market segment are estimated to have grown from RMB59 billion in 2004 
to RMB100 billion in 2006 (approximately  6.9 billion at the 2007 year end RMB to   exchange rate). 
The Company's primary market for its condiment products is Weifang, but it also sells to other cities within Shandong, China's 
second largest province, as well as to neighbouring provinces including Henan, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hebei, Tianjin, Beijing and 
Liaoning.  Its condiments brands are believed to hold a leading market position in Weifang and a signifi cant share of the wider 
Shandong marketplace.
Oi ANNUAL REPORT 2007 3
CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
The Company sells its condiments range via a network of approximately 200 distributors, retailers and numerous outlets of 
large and medium sized supermarket chains in ten provinces and municipal cities in the north-eastern region of the PRC, 
including Wal Mart, Carrefour, Shiji Lianhua and Jialejia.
The Group's animal feed business manufactures higher-margin Premix and Concentrate Feed, and Compound Feed, operating 
two fully automated production lines at a 15,000 square metre plant in Shou Guang City, Shandong.  Shandong is one of the 
largest agricultural and livestock provinces in East China and the Company principally sells its feedstuffs to approximately 200 
distributors, mostly comprising small distributorships located in neighbouring towns or villages.

Revenue           25,268,223          19,273,479  +31.1%

Gross profi t margin 35.3% 35.1% 
Net profi t margin 21.1% 23.0% 
The results for the fi nancial year ended 31 December 2007 show turnover of  25.3 million (2006:  19.3 million) and profi t 
after tax of  5.3 million (2006:  4.4 million).  This represents annual growth of approximately 31.1 per cent. in turnover and 
20.2 per cent. in profi t after tax respectively. 
Gross margin improved slightly from 35.1 per cent. to 35.3 per cent., while net profi t margin dropped from 23.0 per cent. to 
21.1 per cent.. The decline in net profi t margin is largely due to higher corporate overheads in preparation for the listing.

From a segmental perspective, the animal feeds business continued to account for the majority of the Group's revenue 
comprising 53.1 per cent. of total turnover or  13.4 million, with condiments representing the balance of  11.9 million.  
However, the condiments business contributed profi ts of  5.5 million which is approximately double the level of profi ts 
achieved by the animal feeds business.  
While both business divisions are performing well, the Group's strategy is to focus primarily on the condiments business as a 
platform for the Group's future growth.  The margins achievable from the food condiments business are both higher and more 
sustainable.  The trademarked Fushi Hao Tai Tai  brand, offers a greater opportunity for the Group to penetrate new markets 
and charge a premium price for its products.  In recent industry awards, Fushi Hao Tai Tai  was named as one of the top 50 
Chinese brands with respect to soya sauce and vinegar products.
In summary, despite the increased expenses incurred in connection with the implementation of the reverse takeover, the Group 
performed well achieving earnings per share of 14.45 pence (2006: 12.88 pence), representing growth of approximately 12.2 
per cent. 
Strategy and Outlook
The Group's existing condiments manufacturing facility is currently running at near 100 per cent. of its designed production 
capacity.  Accordingly, the Group's primary strategy is to increase the production capacity for the condiments business and  CHINA FOOD COMPANY PLC (formerly VESTPA PLC)
4
raise the brand positioning of its products.  To address the Group's capacity constraints, the Board intends to introduce both a 
new production line for pre-mix animal feed and a new state-of-the-art 50,000-tonnes capacity soya sauce factory.  The pre-
mix production line is expected to be operational in the second half of 2008 while completion and commissioning of the new 
soya sauce factory is anticipated to occur by the end of the year.
To take full advantage of the new factory and the Group's range of premium products, the Group has begun a process of 
brand repositioning.  This process includes increasing prices, re-designing product packaging and a revised advertising and 
marketing strategy.  The Group also intends to strengthen its sales and marketing team as it begins to more aggressively target 
regional expansion.  
While construction and commissioning of our new factory in Shou Guang City will continue throughout the remainder of 
2008, we expect the condiments business to maintain its current operating level during the period as we implement our 
strategy to improve the brand positioning of our products and further develop our range of premium items.  Our aim is to 
maximise revenue and profi t generation from our existing production facilities and prepare the market for the premium 
products that we will be in a position to launch when our new soya sauce factory becomes fully operational.
New Shou Guang City complex
Our new complex in Shou Guang City spans an initial area of 199,657 square metres with rights over an adjoining area of 
67,009 square metres for potential future expansion (266,666 square metres in aggregate, which, to put this into perspective, 
is equivalent to the average size of 25 football fi elds) and is expected to be completed in late 2008.  The complex will 
house, inter alia, our new corporate headquarters, 89,000 square metres of production facilities and 17,000 square metres of 
warehousing.  As at 31 December 2007, the Group had already invested RMB199 million (approximately  13.7 million at the 
2007 year end RMB to   exchange rate) in the project.  The capital investment required is being funded through a combination 
of the proceeds from the listing, internal Group resources and bank facilities.
As part of the Shou Guang City complex, we are building our new 50,000-tonnes soya sauce factory which is scheduled to 
be operational by the end of this year. This facility will produce mid to high grade soya sauce targeted at the increasingly 
affl uent and more discerning population in China.  This market segment is less sensitive to the widespread infl ation that China 
is currently facing and we foresee this business making a signifi cant contribution towards next year's results.
Corporate Developments
Following completion of the reverse takeover on 10 December 2007, the Board of directors was reconstituted. In addition to 
the appointment of an international set of executive directors associated with Full Fortune comprising, Raphael Tham (CEO), 
Feng Bo (COO) and Frank Chau (CFO), we also invited Derek Marsh, to join the Board as a non-executive director. Derek has 
extensive experience in Asia and in particular in both the commercial and political sectors in China. James Cane and Thomas 
Vaughan stepped down from the Board and I take this opportunity to thank each of them for their support and dedication in 
assisting Vestpa in successfully implementing its investment strategy. 
To complement and support the new Board, we have also introduced a new team of professional advisers.  In particular, with 
the appointment of our new auditors, Grant Thornton UK LLP and our internal auditors, BDO Raffl es Consultants Pte. Limited, 
the Board is committed to maintaining a high standard of corporate governance, fi nancial controls and reporting systems.
Outlook
We are delighted with the progress that the Company has made in the current fi nancial year to date which is in line with 
management expectations and look forward to the new Shou Guang City facility coming on stream at the end of 2008 which 
will provide a solid platform for the continued prosperous growth of China Food.
