 Chairman's Statement
Against the backdrop of continuing complications both in China's domestic markets and internationally,
marked in particular by a huge decrease in infrastructure construction spending by China's three telecom
operators, 2010 proved to be a challenging year for China Shoto. In spite of these difficulties, the Company
implemented developments that we believe position us strongly to expand the business as we continue
working to create value for our shareholders. During the year, the Company successfully completed the
acquisition of Rugao Tianpeng, providing us with a battery recycling operation that enables the Group to
meet environmental criteria imposed by key customers. We also continued working to maximise our existing
technology advantages and customer relationships and focused our sales strategy to maintain market share
and remain the largest back-up battery supplier to China's huge telecoms sector. Further, our strong R&D
capabilities resulted in the successful development of new battery types, providing opportunities into other
domestic markets, such as the electric power, railway and bicycle sectors. Considerable progress in our
exploration of key customer potential has been made in overseas markets. We have also continued working
hard to control costs and evaluate more efficient production methods whilst maintaining overall production
levels. At the end of the year, the Company disposed of its entire shareholding in Yangzhou Zhenghe for a
cash consideration of RMB 4 million, yielding a profit on disposal of RMB 820,000.
Results and Dividend
Significant decreases in the central purchasing budgets of China's three telecom operators, higher lead
prices, and wider global competition resulted in a significant decrease in Group sales compared with 2009.
Revenue decreased 7.3 per cent. to  196.95 million (2009:  212.57 million), whilst net profit attributable to
equity holders of the parent decreased by 33.9 per cent. to  15.40 million (2009:  23.30 million).
The Board is not recommending any increase in the full year dividend which will be maintained at 5 pence
per share for the year ended 31 December 2010. If approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting
on 26 April 2011 the dividend will be paid on 4 May 2011 to shareholders on the register at the close of
business on 8 April 2011, with the shares going ex-dividend on 6 April 2011.
Operating Overview
Market Overview
Business segments
Back-up batteries
Sales revenue from the back-up battery business in 2010 decreased 15.8 per cent. to  165.57 million (2009:
 196.53 million).
Power type batteries
Sales from the power type battery business in 2010 increased 95.5 per cent. to  31.36 million (2009:
 16.04 million).
Geographical segments
Domestic sales
Although the Company successfully increased its sales to ZTE and Huawei by 134.5 per cent. to
 35.79 million (2009:  15.26 million), domestic sales still decreased 6.6 per cent. to  189.43 million (2009:
 202.93 million). Sales to the Group's three key customers, China's telecom operators decreased
31.3 per cent. to  109.7 million.
Foreign sales
Foreign sales decreased 22.1 per cent. to  7.52 million (2009:  9.64 million) mainly due to lower sales to
our biggest overseas market, India, which cut imports from China following an increase in domestic Indian
7 suppliers. Sales to India alone decreased 78 per cent. to  1.25 million (2009:  5.70 million). However, the
Group is working to broaden its international presence, and successfully captured new sales in Korea, Russia,
Malaysia and Brazil during 2010.
Key customers
Back-up batteries
Sales to China's three largest telecom operators decreased 31.3 per cent. to  109.7 million (2009:
 159.68 million), although the Group remains the largest single back-up battery supplier to China's three
telecom operators. Mitigating the affect of the revenue drop, sales to ZTE and Huawei Technology increased
134.5 per cent. to  35.79 million (2009:  15.26 million).
During the year, the Group's back-up batteries were used successfully in the China Mobile Pavilion, the
Pacific Pavilion, and the Joint Pavilion of International Organizations at the Shanghai EXPO 2010. This
endorsement has improved the recognition of our brand in the key markets in which the Group operates.
Power type batteries
Following the Company's market development activities over the past three years, sales of power type
batteries improved significantly during 2010. Sales to the primary market (where customers include e-bike
manufacturers) increased 114.8 per cent. to  13.22 million (2009:  6.15 million), whilst sales to the
secondary market (where the customers are e-bike accessory distributors, repair shops and retailers)
increased 103.4 per cent. to  18.14 million (2009:  8.87 million).
The Group continues to strengthen its communications with customers through improvements to its technical
support and after-sale services.
In 2010, the Group also strengthened its presence at key international telecom fairs, such as the Singapore
Telecom Fair, the Brazil International Telecommunications Exhibition, the Russia Telecom Exhibition, the
South Africa Telecom Exhibition, the China International Telecom Fair and the International Engineer
Machine Exhibition, as well as increased media advertising and other marketing strategies.
Lead Acid Battery Recycling Project
In January 2010, the Company acquired Rugao Tianpeng, which now enables the Group to meet internally,
the battery recycling requirements of its key customers. Rugao Tianpeng mainly produces lead alloy as
required by the Group. The Group is now undertaking research on the selection of smelting equipment and
technical demonstrations.
Research and Development
The R&D centre is responsible for developing new types of GEL, AGM and Spiral Wound batteries, and for
the technical development of existing types of these batteries and of super capacitors. New products
developed in 2010 include a full series 12V front terminal 100AH with concasting technology, a 2V flat plate
gel battery, a 12V front-terminal gel battery, and a 12V 100AH AGM specially designed for UPS.
Patents Granted
During 2010, the Group was granted 71 new patents, bringing the total number of patents awarded by the
China Intellectual Property Bureau to 197, including 15 invention patents.
Directorate Changes
There were no changes to the Board of Directors in the year ended 31 December 2010 or up to the date of
signing the annual report.
Social Responsibility
As a China environmentally friendly enterprise, we remain committed to commercial development in
parallel with the Group's wider social responsibility. Balancing the requirements of our shareholders, staff,
8 customers, suppliers, and social and environmental demands, we are committed to pursuing value for the
benefit of the whole community.
The Group has attained ISO14001 environment management system certification and GB/T18001 vocation
health and safety management certification. Further, the Group's products have passed CE Verification, UL
Verification and EU RoHS tests.
Outlook
As foreseen in the 2009 Annual Report, the Group's management faced severe commercial pressures and
challenges in 2010. The year ahead will undoubtedly bring further uncertainties, in particular in relation to
the:
          reduced 7 per cent. GDP target set in the Chinese Government's 12th Five Year Plan  (against
average annual GDP growth of 11.2 per cent. achieved during the period of the 11th Five Year Plan);
          commitment to energy saving and emission reduction made by the Chinese Government at the
Copenhagen Climate Summit;
          focus on social and occupational health;
          increasing labour costs;
          government-imposed restraints on high energy consumption industries;
          continuing decline of infrastructure investment by the Chinese telecom industry;
          adjustments to China's finance and currency policy;
          anticipated global inflation; and
          further appreciation of the Chinese currency, the Renminbi (RMB)
All are expected to affect the Group's business and impact profit margins. In the face of these challenges, the
Group will continue to explore new opportunities in both the international and domestic markets. The newly
built production lines for front terminal and spiral wound batteries will contribute towards growing the
business going forward. The Group will also continue to focus on cost savings, ensuring tighter risk controls
and maintaining environmental compliance in line with its objective of becoming a key green energy solution
provider.
Following a challenging year for the Group, the Directors have conducted a detailed review of the Group's
strategic options. This review has included evaluating the benefits and disadvantages of the admission of the
Company's shares to trading on AIM. The Directors have concluded that it is in the best interests of the
Company and shareholders as a whole for the admission of the Company's ordinary shares to trading on AIM
be cancelled. The Company has issued a circular to shareholders on 30 March 2011 which provides further
details of the proposed cancellation of admission of the Company's ordinary shares to trading on AIM, a
tender offer by Seymour Pierce Limited to purchase certain of the Company's Ordinary Shares as well as a
Notice of Annual General Meeting.
Following the cancellation of the Company's admission to trading on AIM, the Directors will consider
various strategic options which may include a listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Shanghai Stock
Exchange or any other Stock Exchange. It should be noted that there can be no certainty of another listing
on any Stock Exchange.
