Martin Davey - Chairman
At a glance
This has been a positive year for Cranswick. Further progress was achieved in trading and investment was 
made for this progress to continue over the longer term. Pig meat consumption in the UK continues to 
grow. There was a 2 per cent increase in UK per capita consumption during 2012 compared to a fractional 
increase in poultry and reductions in beef/veal and lamb/mutton (source: BPEX). In food service pig meat 
performed well and accounted for 28 per cent of all protein servings, making it the most popular protein out 
of the home (source: BPEX).
The business is totally focused on working closely with both its customer base and supply chain to ensure 
that the consumer has competitively priced food that is nutritious, tasty and a wholesome constituent of a 
balanced diet.
Results
The performance in the year was 
particularly pleasing considering the 
previous year was a 53 week period 
compared to the usual 52 week period this 
past year.
Underlying sales, which exclude the 
contribution from Kingston Foods, rose 
5	per	cent	during	the	year	and	reflected	
growth across most product sectors. 
Particularly strong growth was seen in sales 
of bacon and sausage.  Underlying sales 
were	7	per	cent	higher	on	an	equivalent	52	
week basis.  Total revenue for the year was 
7	per	cent	higher	at	 875	million	and	9	per	
cent higher than previously after adjusting 
for the extra week.
With an unchanged operating margin before 
impairment,	and	after	net	finance	costs	of	
 0.8	million,	adjusted	profit	before	tax	was	
 49.3 million compared to  45.6 million last 
year	which	included	the	benefit	of	the	extra	
week,	an	increase	of	8	per	cent.	Earnings	
per	share	on	the	same	basis	were	8	per	
cent	higher	at	78.9	pence.	Reported	profit	
before	tax	was	 47.4	million	and	earnings	
per	share	were	75.1	pence	compared	to	
 48.4	million	and	78.6	pence	respectively	a	
year ago.
Net	finance	costs	were	covered	63	times	
by	profit	before	net	finance	costs	and	tax,	
compared to 49 times in the previous year. 
Operating	cash	flow	in	the	year	was	strong	
and	after	significant	investment	in	the	
asset base and the acquisition of cooked 
meats supplier Kingston Foods, year end 
net	debt	stood	at	 20.1	million	compared	
to	 21.7	million	a	year	earlier.	This	amount	
is comfortably within the Company's 
borrowing facility and with a very small 
pension scheme exposure puts the balance 
sheet in good shape.
There are full reviews of trading and 
finances	in	the	reviews	by	the	Chief	
Executive and Finance Director which follow.
Investments
During the year Kingston Foods was 
acquired and integrated into the Company's 
cooked meats business. Kingston, which 
has broadened the Group's customer base, 
has performed well since acquisition and I 
welcome Tony Turner, managing director, 
and his colleagues to Cranswick.
Subsequent to the year end the Company 
acquired East Anglian Pigs.  This is a 
successful business involved in the 
breeding,	rearing	and	finishing	of	British	
pigs and a key supplier to the Group's 
Norfolk activities. It operates in the British 
premium outdoor pig-rearing sector and 
has accreditation under the RSPCA Freedom 
Foods and the Red Tractor schemes. This 
strategic acquisition enhances Cranswick's 
commitment to, and greater control over, a 
robust and integrated supply chain with a 
clear focus on premium British ingredients. 
I welcome Adrian Dowling, managing 
director, and his colleagues to Cranswick.
Significant	organic	developments	included	
the purchase of and investment in the 
Riverside fresh pork facility in Hull and the 
construction of the pastry plant in Malton, 
North Yorkshire. These two sites, which 
have only recently been commissioned, will 
contribute to the long term growth of the 
Company.
Investment elsewhere in the business 
contributed additional capacity and 
operating	efficiencies	which	in	turn	have	
enabled the Company to absorb some 
of	the	inflationary	pressures	within	the	
supply chain.  This, along with substantial 
new business from customers later in the 
year,	were	significant	features	of	the	year's	
trading.
Resources were committed to secure 
approval for fresh pork exports to China 
and authorisation has also been obtained to 
supply the Australian market. Along with the 
approval obtained previously for supplies 
to the USA this increases the potential 
international opportunities for the business.
Dividend
The Board is proposing to increase the 
final	dividend	to	20.6	pence	per	share,	 Cranswick plc Report & Accounts 2013 | 3 
Business Review
Corporate Responsibility
Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information
an increase of 5.6 per cent on last year. 
Together with the interim dividend, which 
was raised 4.4 per cent to 9.4 pence per 
share	and	paid	in	January	2013,	this	makes	
a	total	dividend	for	the	year	of	30.0	pence	
per share. This represents an increase of 5.3 
per	cent	on	the	28.5	pence	per	share	paid	
last	year.	The	final	dividend,	if	approved	by	
Shareholders, will be paid on 6 September 
2013	to	Shareholders	on	the	register	at	the	
close	of	business	on	5	July	2013.	Shares	will	
go	ex-dividend	on	3	July	2013.	Shareholders	
will again have the option to receive the 
dividend by way of scrip issue.
Board 
Adam Couch was appointed Chief Executive 
in	August	2012	in	line	with	the	prior	
notification	to	Shareholders.	This	followed	
the appointment of Jim Brisby as Sales and 
Marketing Director and Mark Bottomley as 
Finance Director within the previous three 
years as part of the Board's succession 
planning. Each of these were internal 
appointments and made after giving due 
consideration to potential candidates 
from outside the Company. It illustrates 
to our colleagues the opportunity for 
career development with Cranswick and 
maintains the culture, ethos and values of 
the business.  With the executive team now 
well established I will be moving to a part 
time	role	as	Chairman	with	effect	from	1	
September	2013.
Patrick Farnsworth will be standing down 
from the Board at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting. Patrick has served as 
a	Non-Executive	Director	since	2004	and	
this year will have completed a term of 
nine years at which time, under corporate 
governance guidelines, he will no longer 
be deemed independent. I would like to 
thank Patrick for his contribution to the 
development of the business and wish him 
well for the years ahead. 
Kate Allum, CEO of First Milk Limited and 
former head of European supply chain for 
McDonald's, joins the Board as a Non-
Executive	Director	in	July	2013.	Kate	brings	
operational experience of international food 
markets and broadens the expertise and 
experience within the Board.
Hector Fraser
Hector, one of the 23 local farmers who 
founded	Cranswick	in	the	early	1970's	
and who served as a director until his 
retirement	in	1989,	sadly	passed	away	last	
month. Hector contributed enormously to 
the early development of the business and 
the Directors join with all at Cranswick in 
offering	condolences	to	Hector's	wife	Judy	
and all his family.
Corporate Governance
The Board is mindful of the requirements 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
and embraces this as part of its culture. 
A statement relating to compliance with 
the Code is included within the Corporate 
Governance	Statement	on	page	28.	
Developments since last year include the 
arrangements that have been put in place 
for external evaluation of the Board and its 
procedures as well as the improved gender 
diversity within the Board as referred to 
above.
Staff
The achievements of the year would not 
have been possible without the expertise, 
determination and commitment of the 
management teams and their colleagues 
within the business. Once again they have 
proved themselves to be amongst the best 
in the sector and on behalf of the Board I 
express sincere thanks and appreciation.
Outlook
Cranswick is very much focused on working 
closely with its customers in providing 
a range of products that continues 
to prove popular with the consumer. 
Encouragement is taken from the increase 
in pork consumption within the UK and this, 
coupled with new product development, 
positions the business favourably.
Recent issues in the integrity of the 
supply chain for meat products and the 
introduction	in	2013	of	higher	welfare	
standards for pig production in the EU 
enhance the competitive position of UK 
based pork processors. The Company's 
well	invested	asset	base,	providing	efficient	
means of production and headroom for 
future growth, along with an experienced 
management team and a robust balance 
sheet should enable it to capitalise on 
opportunities that arise. 
The Board looks forward to the task that 
lies ahead as it pursues the continuation 
of Cranswick's successful long term 
development.
