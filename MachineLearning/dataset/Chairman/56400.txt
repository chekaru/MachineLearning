Chairman'sStatement
I am pleased to report on the Group's trading for the
yearended 31 March 2010  a reasonably satisfactory
year forthe Group in what were challenging conditions
for our Aviationbusiness, Jet2.com. It was, however, an
encouraging year for our Distribution business, Fowler
Welch-Coolchain. Group turnover fell slightly to  434m
(2009   439m). Group profitability was impacted by lower
margins in Jet2.com, as a result of reduced customer
demand. Group profit before tax amounted to  22.2m (2009
   33.5m) with earnings per share of 11.1p (2009   19.3p).
Underlying profit before tax, before specific IAS 39 fair value
movements, was  19.1m (2009    28.8m). In consideration
of the Group's current trading performance, the Board
recommends a final dividend of 0.75p per share (2009  
0.71p). If approved at the Group's Annual General Meeting
to be held on 2 September 2010, this dividend will be
payable on 15 October 2010 to shareholders on the Group's
register at the close of business on 10 September 2010. The
associated ex dividend date will be 8 September 2010.
Capital expenditure for the year ended 31 March 2010 
was  32.1m (2009    27.9m). This expenditure related 
principally to long term maintenance spend on aircraft
airframes and engines, together with the acquisition of 
a further Boeing 757-200 aircraft. Net cash flow from
operating activities amounted to  73.2m (2009    58.4m), 
driven principally by improved forward bookings in
Jet2.com. As at 31 March 2010, the Group's net cash 
position amounted to  52.2m (2009    11.8m), at which 
point Jet2.com had received circa  100m of advance
payments from customers in respect of future flights.
Aviation
Jet2.com, the Group's leisure airline, experienced weaker 
customer demand for its passenger services, especially
during off-peak and winter months, with flights to skiing 
destinations being particularly affected. However, early
action was taken to reduce capacity and frequency in
order to control potential losses. At the same time we
continued to develop our services to year round far
sun  destinations, including additional flights to Cyprus, 
Egypt and the Canary Islands, although this was, of course, 
in the face of increased capacity from other operators.
New destinations added to the Jet2.com network in 2009 
were Dalaman, Dubrovnik, Newquay, Tel Aviv and Split,
with capacity closely tailored to anticipated demand.
Overall 2009/10 seat capacity was 7% below that of the
previous year.
Jet2.com is supported by 5 key income streams:
l Seat only sales via the Jet2.com web site, with the
unique proposition of great flight times , 22kg
baggage allowance , allocated seating , and loyalty
points for free flights ;
l Jet2holidays.com   the Group's expanding Tour
Operator, offering great value packages that you can
trust , using Jet2.com's flights and over 600 directly
contracted hotels. Over 64,000 packages were sold in
the year and this is planned to grow substantially
going forward;
l The sale of allocations of seats on our flights to other
tour operators, together with sales to the travel trade,
thereby spreading commercial risk, especially for 
new routes;
l 750 whole-aircraft charters in the year for a wide
range of customers including tour operators, other
airlines, sports teams, pilgrims, government & national
agencies, corporate customers, orchestras and cruise
lines, to over 130 destinations in Europe, the United
States, Canada, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi
Arabia; and
l Our long-term contract with Royal Mail for whom we
operate eight Boeing 737-300 Quick Change  aircraft
on night services, carrying primarily First Class mail.
We have flown services for Royal Mail since 1978 and
very much value our relationship.
During the year we carried over 3.1 million scheduled and
charter passengers.
Akey element in support of our planned future
development is our in-house IT capability. Our software
development team has built our Jet2.com and Jet2holidays.
com reservations systems from scratch, working closely
with our commercial and operational teams to deliver 
to exacting specifications. Our Web and IT team of over
40 employees (encompassing site design, database
management, software development, operational support
and quality assurance) creates and enhances internet 
based solutions that help us to deliver our great leisure
products. We are continually developing and improving
these IT business systems to meet our customers' needs in
afast changing market.

We use several leading-edge analytical tools to
understand our customers' browsing and purchasing
habits and these, together with focus groups and 
website usability testing, give us detailed insights into
how we can better deliver products that are attractive
to our customers. An example of this is our growing
loyalty scheme, myJet2 . We have over 250,000 loyalty
scheme members who earn points for their purchases, 
redeemable against flights.
Our in-house IT capabilities also greatly benefit 
the growth of our ancillary retail revenues, which
include checked-in bags with a sector-leading weight 
allowance of 22kg, seat selection including extra leg
room, pre-booked meals, great value in-flight service,
foreign exchange and commissions on car hire.
Together, these ancillary products brought in  21 per
passenger in the financial year to 31 March 2010.
Our challenge is to differentiate the Company in the
seat-only market. We believe our in-house IT, our
caring and friendly service and our unique selling
propositions go a good way to achieving this. With the
contribution of passengers from Jet2holidays alongside
our other income streams, we feel optimistic that,
provided we are flexible, continue to innovate and to
offer really great value fares, our Aviation business
will prosper.

Chairman'sStatement
Distribution
It gives me great pleasure to report on the considerable
progress made by our logistics business, Fowler Welch-
Coolchain, in the year. The Company specialises in the 
distribution of chilled and ambient foods and other 
consumer products on behalf of leading supermarkets and
their suppliers.
Following the financial year end, in May 2010, after a long
search, the Company completed the freehold purchase of a
500,000 sq. ft., 50,000+ pallet capacity, ambient distribution 
centre located adjacent to the motorway network in
Heywood, Greater Manchester. This acquisition doubles
the Company's distribution footprint. Known as The Hub  
(pictured on pages 8 and 12) and formerly used by major 
retailers, this facility is fully racked and ready to go  
setting the scene for Fowler Welch-Coolchain to greatly
expand its storage and distribution offering in the North
West. The Company's existing North West distribution
business, which is based at Stockport, Cheshire, is vacating
its existing leasehold premises and will be fully operational 
from the Hub before Christmas 2010. It is also planned to
offer temperature-controlled storage and distribution from
The Hub following the installation of cold stores in the
near future. 
IT plays an important role in the success of Fowler Welch-
Coolchain and it is pleasing to report on the successful
implementation of the Company's Manhattan warehouse 
management software, which is delivering measurable
efficiencies and will imminently also be implemented at 
the Hub.
Fowler Welch-Coolchain's Distribution business is
benefiting from a number of new business wins, together 
with increased support from existing customers. We are
delighted to be distributing the full range of products 
sold by Tesco Express convenience stores in the North
East from our distribution centre in Washington, Tyne and 
Wear. Other new customers for this distribution centre
include Cumbrian Seafoods, who have awarded Fowler
Welch-Coolchain their pick-to-order warehousing and 
onward distribution requirements. The quality of service
and growth in business at this site is really encouraging
and rewarding, following our initial freehold investment
four years ago and a substantial upgrade of facilities and
services over the past 18 months. Our distribution business
in Kent and our South Coast operations at Portsmouth and 
Southampton all out-performed expectations in the year, 
through new business wins and increased volumes from 
existing customers.
During the year, considerable internal warehouse 
development has taken place at our Spalding distribution
centre, which is the Company's head office, allowing us to
expand here also. Together with new operations for Tesco
out of Avonmouth, the start of distribution operations in the
Midlands for Mars, the growth of our European operations
on behalf of American Airlines and others, and the 
development of our recently acquired container business,
Bawdsey Haulage Limited in Felixstowe, the commercial
outlook at Fowler Welch-Coolchain, whilst hugely price
competitive, looks encouraging.

Chairman's Statement
Our Staff
Our businesses must maintain their reputation for 
value for money and customer service. Low costs
and flexibility have to be our drivers. This can only be
achieved by focus on these key ingredients by each of
us throughout the Group. I very much appreciate the 
support we receive in this respect   for we rely on
customer demand to fuel our future growth.
Outlook
We hope to grow both our businesses in the year
ahead, despite the continuing challenging economic 
climate. Fowler Welch-Coolchain has good business
development opportunities throughout its operations
and particularly, of course, in the North West.
Given the right conditions, we will also invest in our
leisure airline, with continued emphasis on leisure
destinations, supported by seat-only and package
holiday sales. In the current trading environment,
both businesses have started the year reasonably
satisfactorily, despitethe disruption caused by
the volcanic ash. With increasing demand for our
Distribution services and a carefully tailored airline flying
programme, we are reasonably well placed to deliver
improved financial performance in this financial year .
