 Overview of the 12 months ended 31st December 2008
We are pleased to report continued growth in 2008 for The Davis Service
Group, despite the general economic downturn that progressively
took hold during the second half of the year . Overall, we have delivered
on the expectations we set out in our Interim Management Statement
in October 2008. We have been preparing our operations for the
changing economic conditions and ensuring that we are positioned 
to take both timely and effective action.
At the half year, we reported that 2008 had started strongly, but we
could see evidence of the economic downturn developing, especially
in our UK linen operations and German Healthcare. This early
recognition allowed us to put in place programmes and contingency
plans aimed at mitigating the adverse impacts that we subsequently
encountered during the second half. We expect these difficult
conditions to continue in 2009.
However, despite these challenging times, the markets we service
present us with growth opportunities. We have continued our plant
roll-out in Poland; we have developed our businesses in the Baltics and
the Czech Republic; we have launched new services in Scandinavia
and we have started construction of facilities for our two UK surgical
instrument decontamination contracts which we expect will
commence service during the second half of 2009.
T o handle both a downturn in mature markets and growth
opportunities in new markets requires focused and experienced
management. At all levels, from the six man Executive Board and
country Board members to local plant, sales, service and
administration managers, our management team understands the
requirements of our broad range of customers and will take
appropriate action to address our customers' changing fortunes. 
Results
Revenue increased to  953.9 million in the year, up 16% (2007:
 822.1 million). Adjusted operating profit (before exceptional items
and amortisation of customer contracts and intellectual property
rights) was  116.6 million, compared with  106.6 million last year, 
an increase of 9%. We have seen a significant strengthening of the
European currencies with foreign exchange benefits to revenue and
adjusted operating profit of  75.8 million and  10.7 million
respectively. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, revenue grew
7% and adjusted operating profit declined by 0.7%. The underlying
growth in revenue excluding acquisitions was 2%. Our net finance
expense was  25.3 million compared with  16.3 million last year,

 We are well positioned
to meet the demands 
of our markets' reflecting the acquisitions we have made, the effect of foreign
exchange and the higher variable rates in Continental European
currencies which were charged during the majority of 2008. Adjusted
profit before tax was  91.3 million ( 90.3 million) with an overall net
favourable impact of exchange rates in the year of  7.4 million.
Adjusted earnings per share were 39.3 pence (38.4 pence), an
increase of 2%. Our second half 2008 adjusted earnings per share 
of 22.2 pence (21.5 pence) showed a 3% growth.
Our tax rate on adjusted profit before tax was 26.4%, down from
27.1% last year as a result of the lower rates in Germany and the UK.
Our group rate is expected to remain at around 26.5% in 2009. 
In 2008 net exceptional costs totalled  11.5 million. These included
restructuring costs ( 6.6 million) primarily in Germany where we took
action to lower the direct cost base of our Healthcare business. 
In particular, we announced the closure of two plants, and refocused
central functions in Germany so that they are more closely aligned 
to the growing Workwear business. Given the current economic
uncertainty, we put on hold a number of growth initiatives
throughout the year, incurring exceptional costs of  2.2 million. A net
cost of  2.7 million was incurred in preparing property for disposal.
Amortisation of acquired customer contracts and intellectual property
rights increased to  19.4 million ( 12.4 million) resulting from the
acquisitions we have made both in 2008 and earlier. After these 
items and exceptional costs, operating profit was  85.7 million 
( 95.0 million), profit before taxation was  60.4 million ( 78.7 million)
and basic earnings per share were 24.5 pence compared with 
37.1 pence in 2007.
During the year, we invested selectively in the higher growth areas of
our business. Our net capital expenditure increased to  175.0 million
( 169.3 million), reflecting exchange rate movements and in particular
investing in new plants for Workwear and Facilities in the rapidly
growing market of Poland and also commencing the construction of
facilities for our UK surgical instrument decontamination contracts
( 7.2 million spend in 2008). We reduced our textile spend in constant
currency terms by  12 million to  115.7 million reflecting the
changing economic circumstances as the year progressed. We have
also continued to make improvements in the terms for sourcing of 
our textiles and savings of approximately  10 million were negotiated
in 2008. This programme will continue into 2009 as we have
identified more segments of our business that can be more
economically sourced from the Far East.
Our capital expenditure programme for 2009 has identified a number
of expansion opportunities but these will only be approved as the
trading conditions justify. Investment in textiles is monitored closely
and management are able to react to adjust these investments, which
would have an immediately favourable impact on cash flow and on
profitability over time. 
2008 free cash flow of  47.2 million ( 47.8 million) reflected the
investments that have been progressively made throughout the year,
including the initial investment in decontamination facilities in the 
UK. Free cash flow of our textile maintenance businesses was 
 54.6 million ( 49.1 million), 11% higher than last year. Net debt at
31 December 2008 was  544.1 million ( 367.1 million). The impact
of exchange rates increased net borrowings by  131.4 million with
continental currencies at their strongest at year end, notably the Euro
at  1.03:  1. Since year end, with Sterling strengthening somewhat,
the impact of exchange rates has been reduced by almost  45 million.
 61.6 million was invested in acquisitions including deferred
consideration and financial liabilities assumed, made primarily in the
first half of the year. The group had total facilities of  788 million at
31 December 2008, committed to between 2012 and 2018. Fixed
borrowings totalled approximately  416 million with an average
interest rate of 4.3% per annum in place until 2010 at the earliest. 
We ended the year with net retirement benefit obligation liabilities for
the group of  23.5 million ( 5.7 million). These liabilities are primarily
in the UK, Sweden, Ireland and Germany and are regularly reviewed
by both the group and the pension fund trustees. The next triennial
valuation is scheduled for February 2010.
Overall the group retains a strong balance sheet with net debt to
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA)
of 1.97 times at year end, compared with a covenant level of not
more than 3 times.
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 13.5 pence, which
together with the interim dividend of 6.5 pence paid in October 2008,
gives a total of 20.0 pence, an increase of 3% on last year. 
The dividend will be paid on 7 May 2009 to shareholders on the
register at the close of business on 17 April 2009.
Outlook 
The group is well placed to meet the demands of the current testing
conditions. We are responding to the economic uncertainties by
taking advance action to reduce costs in those parts of the group that
are most directly affected. Our balance sheet will remain robust due to
the cash generative nature of our business and by close management
of the group' s capital expenditure. We have secure financing with
approximately  190 million of headroom at year-end on our facilities
which are committed until at least 2012.
Uncertain market conditions look set to continue but our
management team has considerable experience and is committed to
addressing the challenge. The Board remains confident in the medium
and long term prospects for the group.
