Resilient performance in challenging markets

 4 Debenhams plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Dear shareholder
2012 was a year of celebration across 
the UK for many reasons, not least the 
Queen's Diamond Jubilee and the hosting 
of enormously successful Olympic and 
Paralympic Games. For retailers, however, 
it was one of the most challenging years 
on record.
A warm autumn/winter season was followed 
by a wet spring/summer season which 
depressed consumer demand in an already 
fragile environment. Despite this, I am 
delighted to tell you that Debenhams not 
only weathered these diffi  cult conditions but 
came out in good shape. Our like-for-like sales 
performance during the year was by far the 
strongest for a number of years and we 
delivered our fourth successive year of 
profi t before tax growth*.
This was Debenhams' fi rst year under 
Michael Sharp's leadership. As a vastly 
experienced retailer with an unparalleled 
knowledge of and passion for Debenhams, 
the board was confi dent in Michael's ability 
to develop and execute a successful strategy 
that would write the next chapter in 
Debenhams' history . This has undoubtedly 
been the case. The strategy to create a leading 
multi-channel, international brand is centred 
around the four pillars, about which you can 
read more on pages 16 to 31. Our stakeholders 
- including our customers, employees, 
suppliers and of course shareholders - have 
responded well to this clear articulation of 
strategy and consistent delivery against it 
and we believe that our performance in 2012 
is clear evidence that the strategy is working.
We are aware that capital allocation is a 
subject at the forefront of many shareholders' 
minds. The fi rst priority for the use of capital 
in Debenhams is to invest in the strategy that 
Michael laid out in October 2011. Having 
reinstated the dividend in April 2011, we 
announced in October 2011 that we would 
commence a long-term share buyback 
programme in the second half of the year. 
This decision was based on the board's belief 
that there is little benefi t to the business of 
sustaining leverage below one times net debt 
to EBITDA and that a share buyback 
programme is the most fl exible method to 
return cash to shareholders. The buyback 
started in April 2012 and by the end of the 
fi nancial year we had completed the initial 
tranche of  20 million. The programme will 
continue in the 2013 fi nancial year. 
Debenhams' Corporate Governance Report 
can be found on pages 58 to 62 of this Annual 
Report and the Remuneration Report on 
pages 66 to 74. 
During the year, there were a number 
of changes to the board. Having joined 
Debenhams at the beginning of November 
2011, Simon Herrick was appointed Chief 
Financial Offi  cer at the Annual General 
Meeting in January 2012, replacing Chris 
Woodhouse who resigned from the board 
on that day . Adam Crozier stepped down 
from the board at the end of the fi nancial 
year, having served as a non-executive 
director for more than six years. We thank 
Chris and Adam for their commitment to 
the business. Following Adam's resignation, 
Dennis Millard assumed chairmanship of 
the Remuneration Committee and Mark 
Rolfe succeeded Dennis as chairman of the 
Audit Committee. 
In October 2012 we announced the 
appointment of Peter Fitzgerald to the 
board as a non-executive director. Peter 
has extensive experience in helping retail 
businesses to succeed online with market 
leaders Amazon and Google. We look 
forward to his contribution.
To succeed as we have done in such a 
diffi  cult year has only been achieved through 
the dedication and hard work of the many 
thousands of people who work for 
Debenhams, in our stores, our head offi  ce 
locations, our international offi  ces and our 
logistics and print operations. We do not take 
their support and enthusiasm for our 
business for granted. The board thanks each 
of them for the tremendous eff ort they made 
in 2012 and looks forward to another 
successful year in 2013.

Key performance indicators
Gross transaction value
Gross transaction value (GTV) is a 
measure of overall sales in the business 
and includes sales from own bought 
brands and concession brands. The board 
believes that GTV is a good guide to the 
overall level of activity in the Group.
2012 performance
Debenhams reported an increase in 
GTV of 2.6% in 2012. This was driven 
by like-for-like sales growth in stores 
and online in the UK and international 
businesses as well as new store space.
Profi t before tax
Profi t before tax is the board's principal 
measure of profi tability . The use of 
headline profi t before tax has now been 
discontinued as explained in the fi nance 
review on page 35.
2012 performance
Profi t before tax grew by 4.2% in 2012 
versus the prior year. The main drivers 
of growth were higher sales and 
a smaller interest charge as a result 
of reduced net debt and lower funding 
costs following refi nancing of the 
bank facilities in July 2011.
Like-for-like sales
Like-for-like sales measures the annual 
sales performance of stores that have 
been open for one year or more. The board 
therefore views it as a useful indication of 
organic sales growth across the business.
2012 performance
Like-for-like sales increased by 1.6% in 
2012, the fi rst time it has grown in the past 
fi ve years. This was a good performance 
given the diffi  cult market conditions that 
prevailed throughout the year. Further 
details on the drivers of like-for-like sales 
growth can be found on pages 36.
Net debt
Net debt is the KPI used by the board to 
measure balance sheet strength. It is vital 
that the Company has the right capital 
structure to support its strategic objectives.
2012 performance
Net debt continued to fall in 2012, 
ending the year  15 million lower than 
last year despite higher capex, payment 
of both the 2011 fi nal dividend and 2012 
interim dividend and the  20 million 
initial tranche of the long-term share 
buyback programme.

 6 Debenhams plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Focusing on UK retail 
- number of UK stores
Opening new stores in the UK will 
continue to be a driver of sales growth 
as detailed on page 18. Debenhams 
generates a strong return on investment 
on new stores, averaging c.40% for 
the 35 stores opened since 2007 .
2012 performance
Two new stores were opened during 
2012. The UK store portfolio comprised 
154 stores at year end. The contracted 
store pipeline at the end of the year 
stood at 18 stores scheduled to open 
over the next fi ve years. The fi rst of these, 
Chesterfi eld, opened in September 2012.
Increasing availability and 
choice through multi-channel 
- online sales
Online sales are a good indicator of the 
performance of Debenhams' multi-
channel business. Y ou can read more 
about the developments in this fast 
growing area on page 26.
2012 performance
2012 was another year of strong growth 
in online sales. Group sales increased by 
39.8%, driven by increased choice of 
products, brands and ways to shop and 
a 54% increase in the number of visits 
to debenhams.com. The medium-term 
sales target for online is  600 million.
Delivering a compelling 
customer proposition 
- own bought sales mix
A key part of Debenhams' unique, 
diff erentiated and exclusive customer 
proposition is the high percentage of sales 
generated by own bought brands. 
2012 performance
Group own bought sales mix was 76.7% 
in 2012, down slightly from 77 .1% last year 
largely due to a better performance from 
some concession brands, the addition 
of new concessions in modernised UK 
stores and concession expansion online.
Expanding the brand 
internationally - number 
of international stores
Debenhams' international activities 
comprise stores that we own in Denmark 
and the Republic of Ireland, the franchise 
stores and international online.
2012 performance
The number of international stores 
increased by four in 2012 due to franchise 
store openings. At the end of the year, the 
Debenhams brand traded from 85 stores 
in 27 countries: six in Denmark, 11 in the 
Republic of Ireland and 68 franchise 
stores in 25 countries.
