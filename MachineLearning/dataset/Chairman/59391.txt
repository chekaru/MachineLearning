CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT 
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 
I am delighted to present our audited results for the year ended 31 December 2005, a year in which we achieved rapid 
growth and has resulted in the Group making significant advances in both the Automotive and Consumer Electronics 
market. This growth has been reflected in our increased turnover for the year to  9.3 million, an increase of over 250% 
on the previous year. 
 
Operating Divisions 
The Group has two main operating divisions, Automotive (OEM) and Consumer Electronics (CE). The OEM division 
supplies In-Car Audio Visual equipment and Satellite Navigation systems to the automotive industry in most major 
regions. The CE division supplies Lifestyle products such as MP3 players, portable DVD players and digital video 
cameras to retailers in the UK, Europe and North America. 
 
OEM 
We continued to strengthen our position as a leading supplier of Rear Seat Entertainment systems (RSE) to the 
automotive industry winning key contracts across the UK, Europe and Globally. Designer Vision is now the UK's 
leading supplier of accessory RSE systems to the automotive industry. The Company is confident that further European 
and Global OEM contracts will be awarded during this year making Designer Vision one of the leading suppliers of 
RSE systems in the world. 
 
Volvo 
The Group continues to supply RSE systems to Volvo Car UK Ltd and Volvo Car Netherlands BV for the XC90 model 
and we will be introducing an updated version to our existing system later this year.  
 
BMW 
The Group continues to supply BMW Great Britain Limited with RSE systems for the BMW X5 model and we are in 
further discussions regarding additional products for other vehicle lines. 
 
Ford 
The Group continues to supply Ford Motor Company with RSE systems, DVD players, MP3 players and digital cameras 
and we are currently working with Ford to source other Lifestyle products for inclusion in their customer incentive 
and accessory programs. 
 
Nissan 
The Group continues to supply Nissan Motors (NMGB) and this contract remains very strong and we are currently 
working on additional vehicle lines with various RSE systems. We hope further announcements will be made later this 
year with regards to the launch of new programs. 
 
Renault France 
In September 2005 the Group announced a contract win, supplying Renault D.P.A France with a unique RSE system for 
the new 2007 Renault Laguna. Our engineers have been working very closely with Renault's engineering team in France 
and a new system incorporating DVD, Card readers, MP3 and Mpeg 4 applications will be launched next year. This is 
the first contract win where we are involved at such an early stage of the vehicle development, which has many benefits 
in relation to integration and functionality. We believe that this will be the first system of its kind in the World and 
expected sales volumes for this vehicle line are anticipated to be in the region of 3,500 RSE systems per year. 
 
Jaguar 
In July 2005 the Group was awarded a Pan European program with Jaguar Cars to supply RSE systems for the new X-
Type and S-Type vehicle lines. Both of these programs are going extremely well and we anticipate further orders this 
year.

Land Rover 
In October 2005 the Group announced that it had been awarded a Global contract with Land Rover for a new vehicle 
being launched in September 2006. Annual sales for this vehicle are expected to be approximately 6,000 systems per 
annum over a 3 year period. 
 These contracts reinforce Designer Vision's relationship with the automotive industry and we look forward to adding 
further prestigious clients during 2006.  
 
CE 
The acquisition of Tech Trade Limited introduced Designer Vision to the fast growing CE market with its existing 
relationship with Toys R Us, the Tech Trade business has been integrated into Designer Vision and since then Designer 
Vision has gone on to win major contracts with Toys R Us Europe, Virgin Megastores and other UK high street 
retailers. 
 
Tech Trade Limited was acquired for a consideration of up to  3 million, to be satisfied by the issue of shares in the 
Company, of which  2.9 million was subject to the achievement of pre tax profits of  1.5 million over 18 months to July 
2006. This target will not be achieved and as a result Designer Vision will not pay any further consideration for this 
acquisition. Despite not achieving the original targets for the earn out, this retail division has performed incredibly well 
and contributed over  6 million in sales during the first 9 months, I am confident that this will be significantly eclipsed 
in 2006. 
  
Toys R Us 
The Group continues to supply Toys R Us in the UK and Europe with a number of products including a variety of 
portable DVD players, Twin Screen portable DVD systems, digital cameras and MP3 players.  
 
Virgin 
Our relationship with the Virgin group continues to grow and we are currently working closely with them to develop 
new and exciting products. 
Relationships with our manufacturing partners in the Far East are of paramount importance to the Group, in maintaining 
our position at the cutting edge of technology, we have signed partnership agreements with a number of factories in 
China and Taiwan. 
The Designer Vision  brand is now becoming recognised for its quality and competes with some of the biggest names 
in the industry, in both the OEM and CE sectors.  
 
 
Financials 
On 17 May 2005, the Group announced a placing of 7,846,154 new shares raising  510,000 before associated expenses. 
On the 6 December the Group announced a further placing to fund expansion by placing 18,333,333 shares raising a 
further  550,000. These proceeds, together with new bank facilities of  5 million, will be used to fund the working 
capital requirements of the business and enable the Group to exploit further opportunities as they arise. 
The company secured on the 8 June 2006 a convertible loan for up to  1 million, which will be repaid within a 6 month 
period from draw down, this money is to be used to fund existing orders. 
 
In the year to 31 December 2005, the Group more than tripled its turnover from  2.6m to  9.2m and the pre-tax loss 
amounted  370,479. The basic loss per share was (0.47)p compared to (0.63)p in 2004. No dividend is being 
recommended as the Group continues to concentrate its resources on the rapid growth of the business.

CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT (continued) 
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
The Company has now achieved sufficient mass whereby it can manage its growth easier and be far more profitable 
going forward. We are confident that after the significant investment made, in 2006 the Company will make its maiden 
profit. 
 
Post Period End 
 
Nissan 
In February 2006 the Group announced a further contract win to supply RSE systems for the new Nissan Pathfinder, 
supplying an overhead DVD console. 
 
Volvo 
The Group was awarded a further contract by Volvo in March 2006 to supply a new portable RSE system which was 
designed and developed by Designer Vision specifically for Volvo UK giving Volvo customers the option of a fixed 
RSE system or a more affordable portable solution. We believe the growth potential for the new portable system is vast 
and we anticipate a large number of systems being sold in 2006. 
  
 
Renault 
In April 2006 the Group announced a contract win to supply Renault UK with RSE systems using Blaupunkt screens for 
the Renault Espace this is first contract where we are partnering Blaupunkt since signing a joint venture agreement, this 
reinforces our strategic partnership with one of the largest suppliers to the global automotive industry.  I am confident 
that similar programs will follow for other OEM's. 
  
Toys R Us 
Also in April 2006 the Group announced a contract win with Toys R Us USA worth over US$10 million to supply 
portable DVD players and MP3 players. These orders are now being satisfied and we have received further orders from 
the US to supply additional product.  
 
Carphone Warehouse 
Furthermore, in April 2006 the Group announced a contract win to supply Carphone Warehouse with MP3 players. 
Following this successful nomination, further orders are expected during the course of the year. 
 
Board Changes 
In January 2006 Godfrey Bilton stepped down as Group Chairman for health reasons and Mohsin Shameem was 
appointed by the Board as an Executive Director. In January 2006 Andy Mintern stepped down as Finance Director to 
the Group and Mohsin Shameem was then appointed as the new Finance Director. In February 2006, Angelo Panayiotou 
was appointed by the Board as the new Chairman for the Group. The Group also appointed Ian Hopkins as a non 
Executive Director in March. Ian is an ex Virgin senior executive who was responsible for business development of 
Virgin Megastores. I would like to welcome both Mohsin and Ian to the Board and to thank Godfrey for his valuable 
contribution to the Group. 
 
Outlook  
The results for the year reflect a continuing period of rapid growth and transition for the Group which is continuing to 
move forward very strongly in 2006. During the past two years much investment has been placed into our OEM division 
and I am delighted that this investment is now generating major contract wins. We look forward to significant returns 
from this investment.

CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT (continued)  
 
________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 
We have a strong order book as well as potential for new business, in both our OEM and retail businesses, the Group is 
also looking to make further acquisitions in 2006 to complement our existing business.  
 
Trading in the first five months of the current year to 31 May has been significantly ahead of the same period last year.  
Consequently, we expect our performance for the year to 31 December 2006 to be well ahead of current market 
forecasts which enables the Board to be confident of the outlook for the year. 
  
Once again, the improvement in the performance of the Group is a reflection of the quality, dedication and the 
professionalism of all the people we employ and in particular I would like to especially thank Paul Cave, Group 
Managing Director of our OEM Division and Chris Payne the Managing Director for our Retail Division. On behalf of 
the Board, I would also like to thank everyone else concerned for their contribution in making Designer Vision the 
exciting company it is.
