 4 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 1
Introduction
I am pleased to report that Aggreko has delivered 
another strong performance in 2011, with underlying
1
 
growth in revenues of 22% and in trading profit
2
 of 
26%. The Group also achieved solid headline growth 
despite the fact that 2010 was an extraordinary year for 
our revenue from major sporting events, with the FIFA 
World Cup, the Vancouver Winter Olympics and the 
Asian Games together accounting for about  87 million 
of revenue in 2010. Such a happy coincidence of three 
world-class events running in the same year happens 
only once every four years. We therefore feel justified  
in focusing on the underlying results, which we define as 
being revenue and trading profit excluding these events, 
pass-through fuel
3
, and currency movements, as well as 
a small amount of revenue from the London Olympics 
which arose in 2011. The strength of our performance 
is tribute to the breadth and diversity of the Group and 
the continuing demand we see in all our key markets.
Amongst our businesses, and on an underlying basis, 
International Power Projects grew revenue by 25% and 
trading profit by 33%. Our Local business delivered 21% 
growth in revenue, and 15% growth in trading profit.
At a Group level, reported revenues increased by 
14%, profit before tax increased by 6% to  324 million 
(2010:  304 million) and diluted earnings per share 
before a  29 million exceptional tax credit
4
 increased 
by 10% to 86.76 pence (2010: 78.98 pence).
Strategy
Aggreko's strategy has remained broadly unchanged 
since it was developed in 2003. Our goal is to deliver 
attractive and growing returns to shareholders, excellent 
service to customers, and rewarding careers to our 
employees as the leading global provider of temporary 
power and temperature control. We focus on growing 
our business organically, supported by fleet investment 
and geographic expansion, but we will also make 
acquisitions where they can add value. We continued to 
invest heavily in the business in 2011, with fleet capital 
expenditure of 2.2 times depreciation. In addition,  
on 31 March 2011 we completed the acquisition of 
N.Z. Generator Hire Limited for a total consideration 
of  14 million. We also continued our strategy of 
geographical expansion in the Local business, opening 
fifteen new locations in the year, and acquiring four 
others as part of the N.Z. Generator acquisition; most 
of these new locations were in emerging markets  
where economies are growing most quickly. 
In our last five year strategy review in 2007, we set out 
our view that the business could deliver, on average, 
double-digit revenue and earnings growth over the 
period 2007-2012, with fleet capital expenditure 
expected to be around  1 billion over the same 
period. I am pleased to report that we are well ahead 
of plan, having delivered compound annual growth 
over the first four years of 19% in revenue and 26%  
in operating profit. Fleet capital expenditure over the 
period has averaged  263 million per annum - which 
is above our original forecast reflecting the strength  
of revenue and profit growth; in 2012 we expect to 
invest around  350 million in our fleet. We believe 
that our strategies for both the Local and International 
Power Projects businesses are working well, and that 
our performance in 2012 will allow us to report that  
the targets we set in 2007 have been significantly 
exceeded. Work is already well underway on the next 
five year strategy for the period 2013 - 2017 which 
will be set out along with our results in March 2013.

Directors' Report
Ethics Committee
Integrity and honesty in all our business dealings are 
central to Aggreko's reputation and long term success. 
For many years the Group has had a clear and robust 
ethics policy, and strong related procedures. Last year 
the Board took the further step of establishing a 
committee whose principal tasks are to advise the 
Board on the development of strategy and policy on 
ethical matters, and to oversee Aggreko's policies  
and procedures for the identification, assessment, 
management and reporting of ethical risk. The members 
of the Committee are David Hamill, Ken Hanna, and 
myself as Chairman. The Ethics Committee had its first 
meeting in February 2011 and a report on its activities 
is included in the Annual Report on page 68.
Board 
At the Company's AGM in April 2011, I announced 
that I intend to step down as Chairman and also from 
the Board of Aggreko at the AGM in April 2012 at 
which point I will have served ten years as Chairman 
and fifteen years on the Board. Over the last ten years 
your Company has enjoyed compound growth of 19% 
in earnings per share and the share price has increased 
six-fold. I shall be succeeded as Chairman by Ken 
Hanna, who joined the Board in October 2010; Ken  
is Chairman of Inchcape plc and a Non-executive 
Director of Tesco plc.
It has always been my belief that the most important 
investment that a company can make is in its  
people, and there is no doubt in my mind that the 
outstanding success of your Company is due to its 
dedicated and talented management team, and to the 
quality and determination of its workforce worldwide. 
On behalf of all the owners of the business, I would 
like to thank them all for their contribution to the 
success of your Company.
Return to shareholders
In July 2011 we completed a  148 million return  
of capital to shareholders, equivalent to 55 pence per 
ordinary share; a further  3 million will be paid in 2012 
to those shareholders who elected to defer all or part 
of their return. Following the return, at 31 December 
2011 our net debt stands at 0.7 times EBITDA 
(Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and 
Amortisation) which has moved us closer to our longer-
term target of around 1 times net debt to EBITDA.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a 10% increase in the 
dividend for the year as a whole; this will comprise a 
final dividend of 13.59 pence per ordinary share which, 
when added to the interim dividend of 7.20 pence, 
gives a total for the year of 20.79 pence. At this level, 
the dividend would be covered 4.2 times on a pre-
exceptional basis. Subject to approval by shareholders, 
the final dividend will be paid on 22 May 2012 to 
ordinary shareholders on the register as at 20 April 
2012, with an ex-dividend date of 18 April 2012.
Funding
Net cash inflow from operations during the year 
increased by 9% to  509 million (2010:  468 million). 
This funded capital expenditure of  418 million, which 
was  149 million higher than in 2010. Net debt at  
31 December 2011 of  365 million was  232 million 
higher than the previous year mainly as a result of the 
increase in capital expenditure and the  148 million 
return of capital to shareholders.
The Group maintains sufficient facilities to meet  
its normal funding requirements over the medium 
term. At 31 December 2011 these facilities totalled 
 669 million in the form of committed bank facilities 
arranged on a bilateral basis with a number of 
international banks, and private placement notes 
which were put in place during the first half of 2011. 
Since the year end we have put in place a further  
 30 million of committed facilities.  6 Aggreko plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 1
Outlook for 2012
The business has had a strong start to the year. 
Having entered 2012 with 21% more power on hire 
than the prior year in International Power Projects 
and 14% more in the Local business, the growth  
rate in both businesses has accelerated. 
Our International Power Projects business has had 
very strong order intake in the first two months of the 
year, with almost 300MW of new orders taken so far, 
mainly in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. At the 
end of 2011 we had a record 14 months of forward 
order cover and the prospect pipeline remains strong.
Amongst the Local businesses, Europe & Middle East 
have had a good start, and, with the London Olympics 
in the second half, should have a strong year. North 
America likewise is showing double-digit growth in 
rental revenue in the first two months. Aggreko 
International's Local businesses continue to benefit from 
our strategy of expanding our depot network in fast-
growing markets; at the end of February they have over 
30% more power on rent than the prior year, and we 
currently plan to open about 20 new facilities in 2012. 
Given the strong start to the year, we are planning  
to increase the rate of investment in fleet; we now 
expect that our fleet capital expenditure in 2012  
is likely to be about  30 million higher than we 
anticipated at the end of December, at around  
 350 million. We are confident that the business will 
deliver strong growth in the first half of 2012; at this 
early stage of the year, we are more cautious about the 
second half of 2012, when, in any case, comparatives 
will be tougher. Overall, we continue to believe that 
we will deliver another year of good growth in 2012.
