 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008
Chairman's statement
The progress reported in my statement a year ago has continued throughout
2008. Results have improved across the group, with operating profit before
exceptional items increasing by 16% compared to 2007. Operationally, 2008
finished well, which, together with significant movements in certain key
currencies, meant that operating results were ahead of our expectations. 
Despite a full programme of capital
expenditure in the year, strong cash flows
enabled us to reduce net debt from  27.3
million last year to  24.0 million. The balance
sheet is strong and our existing financial
resources give us the capacity to continue
to grow the business. 
Financial highlights
Reported revenue for 2008 was  183.1
million (2007:  156.3 million), representing
an increase of 17% over 2007. On a
constant currency basis, sales revenue
would have been up 6% to  165.9 million. 
Operating profit before exceptional items
was  20.6 million compared with  17.7
million in 2007. 2007 operating profit has
been re-stated to reflect a change in the
accounting treatment of net pension finance
income. This has been moved to financing,
resulting in a reduction of  0.6 million in
operating profit in both 2007 and 2008. 
Profit before tax and exceptional items rose
21% to  18.8 million (2007:  15.6 million).
Pre-tax profit after exceptional items was
 15.3 million in 2008 against  16.2 million 
in 2007. 
Basic earnings per share before exceptional
items rose from 6.4p for continuing
operations in 2007 to 8.2p in 2008. 
In the interim report, we indicated a 
re-organisation of our manufacturing facilities
in the Czech Republic, and reported an
exceptional non-cash impairment charge
related to that of  3.1 million. We also noted
that, during the second half, a further  0.6
million would be provided to cover the cost
of redundancy and transfer of assets,
bringing the total exceptional cost for the
closure of Korenov to  3.7 million. 
These actions will benefit the company 
and, along with additional investment in
replacement lines this year, will generate
annual savings of around  2.0 million from
2010. 
There was also exceptional income of  0.2
million, being further revenue from the 2005
sale of land at Moodiesburn. Operating profit
after exceptional items was  17.1 million
(2007:  18.3 million). 
The net impact of currency movements 
was favourable to the group, largely due to
the relative weakness of sterling during the
second half of 2008. The net benefit to the
group's operating profit of these currency
movements during the year was  2.4 million.
Net debt reduced to  24.0 million 
(2007:  27.3 million). 
Operational highlights
Sales volumes of collagen casings rose by
2.4% overall, with particularly good growth
in edible collagen volumes, offset by some
reductions in non-edible collagen volumes. 
Distributed product revenues grew by 19%
to  21.5 million, much of this as a result of
the relative strength of the euro, the currency
in which most distributed products are sold.
Revenue from the sale of other products,
including collagen film, collagen gel,
biomedical collagen and plastics, increased
by 29% in 2008, with growth in each of
these product groups. 
In our operational review in January 2008,
we stressed that pricing was to be given
precedence over volume and market share,
and we are now able to report that we
achieved average price increases of 3.2%
overall during the year on a constant
currency basis, whilst also increasing sales
volumes.
Europe and Africa
Sales volume growth in edible collagen
casing was most evident in the developing
markets of Eastern Europe, where volumes
rose by 15%, but was also significant in
South Africa and Kenya. UK sales continued
to recover well, ending the year more than
2% ahead of 2007 levels, due in part to new
and improved products developed in our
Scottish operation. There were reduced
sales volumes into the more mature markets
of Western Europe and Scandinavia. 
We are currently investing approximately
 5.0 million in new lines in Jilemnice in 
the Czech Republic, which will become
operational in the third quarter of 2009. 
As reported in our interim statement, the
Board took the decision to reorganise
Cutisin manufacturing facilities, by adding
new lines and closing the old manufacturing
facility at Korenov with effect from the
summer of 2009. This plant has been kept
running for several years to provide
additional capacity for the business, but has
become increasingly expensive in terms of
manufacturing costs, energy efficiency and
maintenance. These changes will generate
full-year savings of  2.0 million from 2010 
for the same output, with enhanced product
quality and significantly reduced carbon
dioxide emissions and water usage. 
There was a write-down of  0.6 million of a
test facility in Jilemnice (purchased in 1999)
which is no longer operational, saving an 
on-going depreciation cost of  0.1 million
per year. This was not treated as an
exceptional item. 
The manufacturing performance at our
Scottish operation improved as 2008
progressed, with higher profitability relative 
to 2007 despite substantially increased
energy costs. Overall, however, there is still
much work to do in Scotland, particularly as
regards sales pricing, before adequate levels
of profitability are achieved. 
04 Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008
Americas
Excluding the impact of the switch of a
major customer from our casings to our
collagen gel in late 2007, sales volumes in
the US were 7% ahead of 2007, while sales
to the emerging Latin American markets
showed excellent growth, up by 24% year-
on-year. The impact of conversion from gut
to collagen casings has had a particularly
favourable impact on Latin American sales.
Devro continued to consolidate its position
as the leading supplier of collagen gel for
co-extrusion, with increased sales year-on-
year. The rate of growth of gel sales slowed
during the second half of 2008 and demand
is expected to be flat in 2009. 
In US dollar terms, sales revenues in the
Americas as a whole were almost 6% ahead
of 2007 (17% in sterling terms).
Asia/Pacific
Sales growth in Asia/Pacific remained 
strong in 2008. While this was most evident
in China, we also achieved growth in the
established Japanese market, the
Philippines and other South East Asian
countries. The growth in the Chinese market
is attributable to the increasing popularity of
Western-style sausage. Selling prices in
China remain below average, but these are
being increased at a faster rate than
elsewhere. More modest gains in sales
volumes were also achieved in the mature
markets of Australia and New Zealand.
Sales revenues in the Asia/Pacific region as
a whole rose by 21% as compared to 2007.
The additional manufacturing capacity in
Australia, installed in late 2007, is performing
at higher levels of efficiency than we had
anticipated in our original plans, giving better
manufacturing costs. 
Input prices
The overall cost of raw materials in 2008
was broadly similar to that of 2007, although
there is an expectation that hide prices will
increase in 2009. The current downturn in
the automobile, furniture and aerospace
industries is having a significant impact on
the availability of cattle hides, our prime
source of raw collagen. Management is
actively involved in identifying new sources
of hides, to ensure a sustainable supply of
this vital raw material. 
Energy costs increased significantly in 2008,
having an adverse effect on operating profit
of  1.5 million as compared to 2007.
Although global energy costs have fallen 
in recent months, utility costs in 2009 will
remain at higher levels for approximately the
first half of the year, because of the timing 
of some fixed-price supply contracts. 
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of
3.025 pence (2007: 3.025 pence) bringing
the total for the year to 4.45 pence (2007:
4.45 pence). The final dividend will be paid
on 15 May 2009 to shareholders on the
register as of 17 April 2009. 
We previously indicated our intention to
increase the level of dividend cover by
growing earnings while maintaining dividend
levels. 
Board changes
As previously announced, John Neilson, 
our Finance Director since 1993, retired on 
1 May 2008, and was succeeded on the
same date by Peter Williams. The company
therefore enters 2009 with a substantially
reconstituted Board, with the two executive
directors having been appointed in the past
two years, and two non-executives having
joined the Board since the start of 2005.
Last year, I announced my intention to step
down as Chairman at the forthcoming
Annual General Meeting, once a successor
had been identified. I am pleased to say that
the recruitment process is well advanced. 
Outlook 
These are interesting times. The broader
economic environment is setting
unprecedented challenges for all businesses.
However, with over 80% of revenues 
coming from overseas, Devro's global base
and market-leading position give it a solid
platform for further progress. There is also
scope to continue the improvement recently
seen in the Scottish business. Our ongoing
commitment to increased capital investment
underlines management confidence in the
prospects for the business in 2009 and
beyond.
The thanks of the entire Board of Directors
go to everyone employed in the organisation
worldwide for their efforts over the past
successful year for Devro.
