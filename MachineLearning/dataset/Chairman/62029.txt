  The Group has consolidated

to basic, shorter term 
objectives.'
David Morrow
Chairman's and Chief Executive's Statement
Introduction
During this period, the Group has consolidated its position 
as the leading retailer in the UK specialist caravan and 
leisure industry whilst shifting its clear operational focus to 
basic, shorter term objectives.
After the fi rst six months to February 2008, when all 
market segments were ahead of the previous year and 
results were in line with expectations, the year became 
increasingly dominated by the deterioration in the 
fi nancial markets and the subsequent and signifi cant 
fall in consumer confi dence. Despite a generally more 
resilient customer profi le, these factors led to a fall in the 
UK market for leisure vehicles in the second half year to 
August 2008.
In the second six months, the infi ll acquisition of the 
Cannock dealership and the transfer of the small 
Cardiff business to the larger and nearby Newport site 
were completed to maintain the Group's size at 15 
outlets of which 12 are freehold properties. In parallel, 
the attractiveness of the Group's large retail stores 
at Darlington and Chorley was further enhanced by 
comprehensive refi ts.
At the same time, the weaker patterns of demand were 
becoming more defi ned and predictions of recession 
more commonplace. With the tougher conditions 
likely to persist for some time, the Group began the 
implementation of a series of strategic and operational 
measures designed to protect the fi nancial health of the 
business and the loyalty of the growing customer base.
Financial Results
Revenue in the year ended 31 August 2008 was 
 135,767,000 (2007:  54,299,000) and the loss from 
operations was  (1,863,000) (2007:  238,000). After 
adjusting for share-based payments and inventory and 
receivables provisions the profi t from operations was 
 1,620,000 (2007:  753,000). During the year, in the 
opinion of the Directors, restructuring costs of  1,128,000 
(2007:  515,000) were incurred. After making further 
adjustments for these restructuring costs, the profi t from 
operations would have been  2,748,000 (2007:  1,268,000)
The loss before tax was  (3,727,000) (2007:  (571,000)).
The profi t before tax, share-based payments, inventory 
and receivables provisions and restructuring costs was 
 884,000 (2007:  458,000).
Basic and diluted losses per share were (2.07)p (2007: 
(0.90)p).
For an explanation of the restructuring costs, please see 
the Finance Director's Review.
Dividend
At this stage in the Group's development, the Board does 
not intend to declare a dividend.
The Market
Discover Leisure operates within the UK caravan, 
motorhome and camping equipment sector (estimated 
to be worth  1.6 billion p.a.) and the UK outdoor clothing 
equipment sector (estimated to be worth  1.2 billion p.a.).
Over the last ten years, the shape and stability of the 
largest market segment, leisure vehicles, has gradually 
changed due to the increasing popularity of the freedom 
and convenience of the modern motorhome. 
 Year to August
Product  1999 2004 2008
Tourers (trade sales) 21,200 32,370 29,938
Motorhomes (regs) 4,700 8,487 10,980
TOTAL 25,900 40,857 40,918
The key customers within Discover's target markets are 
aged over 50 and view caravanning and outdoor leisure 
as a lifestyle. Coupled with a higher availability of capital, 
this segment has hitherto been able to protect their 
lifestyle from the effects of credit squeezes. However, 
the impact of the unprecedented fall in confi dence did 
begin to adversely impact this market during the summer.

UK trade sales of touring caravans and holiday homes 
slowed signifi cantly in the six months to August 2008 
as demand fell. Registrations of motorhomes stayed 
ahead of the previous year until July 2008 when they fell 
31%.  Collectively, the market fell 22% in the quarter to 
August 2008 compared to last year, resulting in a small net 
reduction for the year.

It should be noted that motorhome registrations in 2007 
were artifi cially high after production problems in 2006. 
Operational Results
After two years of rapid growth, the original plan for 
the year to August 2008 was to consolidate the recent 
acquisitions and to grow organically. However, when the 
full impact of the economic crisis became clear during 
early summer, the Group narrowed its approach to focus 
solely on delivering the expected profi t for the year, cash 
generation, cost reduction and making tactical market 
share gains.
First Half Year to February 2008
Integration
To match the newly unifi ed banking structure, the 
products, services, and systems of the newly acquired 
Barrons and Mendip businesses were successfully 
integrated with those of Harringtons and Leisure World 
into a single new organisational structure with one IT, 
accounting and procedural system.
Re-branding
After research had shown that customers were primarily 
looking for quality outdoor products with improved levels 
of service, all of the Group's operations were rebranded 
as one, consistent Discover offering. 
Second Half Year to August 2008
In parallel with delivering the expected profi t for the year, 
operational objectives were set for the 2008/9 fi nancial 
year and substantial progress was achieved in the six 
months to August 2008.
Cash Generation   Objective: The average inventory 
carrying value of the 08/09 new vehicle inventory to be at 
least 30% lower than the 07/08 average.
   Previously placed inventory orders either reduced or 
cancelled.
   Fully paid units reduced by clearance sales and sales 
incentives.
   New ordering system implemented which tracks 
requirements against manufacturers' unsold inventory, 
production capability and lead times.
Other cash actions completed:
   Vehicle and trade receivables reduced by 42% between 
July 08 peak and October 08 month end.
   Capital expenditure frozen except for absolutely 
necessary items.
Cost Reduction   Objective: To reduce the total 08/09 
pre-interest costs to a maximum of 89% of the 07/08 
actual costs, a reduction of  2 million.
   Management restructure completed.
   Headcount reduction completed.
   Advertising spend reduced by switch to monthly direct 
mailing. The new, 16 page, in-house publication  Lets 
Go Outside' is now sent to 425,000 users of Discover 
products in the UK every month.
Market Share Gains   Objective: to provide the highest 
levels of customer service in the UK.
   Industry-leading  6 Star Guarantee' launched.
   Customer service call centre launched.
   24 hour technical helpline opened.
Other actions completed:
   Share of UK motorhome registrations in the year to 
August 2008 increased to 8% (2007: 1%).
   Online sales generated  434,000 within the fi rst six 
months.
   New motorhome rental business launched.
Year to August 2009
For the new fi nancial year, the critical success factors for 
the Group are the stability of trading and the effectiveness 
of the operational performance against the budgeted 
targets for profi t and cash.

Chairman's and Chief Executive's Statement continued
The 2009 strategic objectives are as follows:
   Deliver the budgeted cash fl ow.
   Reduce costs by increasing labour effi ciencies and 
eliminating waste.
   Achieve and maintain customer service excellence.
   Make further share gains via the new direct marketing 
and online channels, after sales businesses and new 
products (e.g. Point of Sale insurance).
   Minimise vehicle inventory with the new supply chain 
management process. 
   Continue to develop industry-leading core 
competencies and processes.
Discover Team
We would like to place on record our appreciation of the 
tremendous contribution made by the Discover team in 
2008. They have managed to maintain their energy and 
enthusiasm throughout an increasingly diffi cult year and 
their commitment to Discover will be invaluable in 2009.
Funding Position
The Group's banking facilities have been renewed with 
covenants revised in line with the Group's forecasts.
Outlook
At this stage, the turmoil in the fi nancial markets and the 
low level of consumer confi dence make it very diffi cult to 
predict the likely outcome for 2009.
Previous experience indicates that an average of two years 
is required to emerge from a credit induced crisis so we 
are assuming that the market in 2009 will stay at its current, 
lower level and that trading will be very competitive. The 
Group has already adapted to these conditions to achieve 
stability and maintain confi dence. Our budget is based on 
this scenario and we will remain focused on cash, costs and 
tactical market share gains. Good progress was made in all 
of these areas before and after year end with cumulative 
cost savings of  2 million forecast for 2009. Further 
restructuring costs have been incurred in the current year 
and the Board continues to monitor the situation closely. 
The Group has also made appropriate provisions for 
slow-moving inventory and bad debts and the outlook is 
lightened by the recent falls in interest rates, fuel prices, 
infl ation and the pound, with the latter likely to lead to 
more people holidaying in the UK.
As a seasonal business, the fi rst half year comprises the 
quieter winter period with profi ts normally being made 
in the second six months. As expected, the market in 
September and October remained at the lower levels 
seen in the fourth quarter of last year but the Group's 
sales for the fi rst quarter to November were in line with 
expectations. We look forward cautiously to what is likely 
to be a challenging year.
