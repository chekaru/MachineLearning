 45 2 Chairman's Statement
I am pleased to report another excellent set of results from our operating subsidiary E Wood Limited which achieved record sales
and operating profit for 2006. We have also today announced a recommended cash offer of 323 pence per share from 3M UK
Holdings Limited (3M ) for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of the Company. Further details are set out in the
offer announcement, and the offer document which is being sent to shareholders.
Results
Group turnover from continuing operations for E Wood Holdings Plc (the group ) for the year was  27.1 million (2005:  24.4
million) with an operating profit from continuing operations of  3.5 million (2005:  2.9 million after restatement relating to share
based payments). Earnings per share on continuing operations were 21.4 pence (2005: 16.0 pence after restatement).
E Wood Limited, our last remaining operating subsidiary, has continued to be a strong generator of cash. At the year end we had
achieved our aim of having net cash, amounting to  84,000 compared to net debt of  3.0 million at 31 December 2005.
The group's total operating profit in 2006 is  3.5 million (2005:  1.9 million as restated).
An interim dividend of 1.5 pence was paid in October 2006. No final dividend is proposed since the earnings for the second half
of the year are reflected in the offer price agreed with 3M.
E Wood Limited (E Wood )
E Wood again reported record results. This is the result of the hard work and tenacity of Chris McDonnell and his team. Chris
McDonnell reports more fully on the performance of E Wood in the Operational Review starting on page 4. 
Solvitol - discontinued business
As mentioned in the 2006 Interim Report, although in August 2006 Solvitol was placed into administration by its new owners,
the group secured payments during the year which brought the aggregate cash consideration received on the sale of Solvitol to
 3.3 million - for this relief much thanks!
Corporate and Management  
During the year we purchased and cancelled 353,450 ordinary shares representing 2.93% of the issued share capital at 1 January
2006.
As always, our employees contributed enormously to the Company's performance and we thank them for all their efforts
throughout the year.
Annual general meeting (AGM )
Normally there is enclosed with the Annual Report the notice convening the AGM. Since the timetable for the 3M offer covers
the period within which the AGM would normally take place, the AGM is being deferred until the offer period has expired.
Should the offer period be extended and it becomes necessary to convene the AGM, a separate notice will be sent to shareholders.   
The future is built on the past
We are by nature a forward looking company but occasionally, we allow ourselves the luxury of looking back to see what has
been achieved. The recommended cash offer from 3M is a major turning point and an appropriate time for such a moment's
reflection. 
As Torday & Carlisle PLC, in March 1998 the Company became an activist industrial holding company. In February 2000, when
the share price was 21 pence, we made an offer for and acquired Meristem plc and its three operating subsidiaries. Since that
acquisition we have implemented a strategy of improving and developing the existing businesses and then looking to realise
value for the Company's shareholders on their disposal. Since March 2000, the proceeds of the disposals together with strong
internal cash flow have enabled us, by a combination of dividends, share buybacks and the November 2002 capital reduction, to
return to shareholders a total of approximately  19.8 million in cash. During the same period, the number of shares in issue
reduced from approximately 63.5 million to the present approximate 11.9 million. In February 2000, the share price was 21 pence
per share compared to the current price offered by 3M of 323 pence per share - a multiple of over 15 times in 7 years, a not
unsatisfactory result.
Our current share register includes a number of loyal and supportive private shareholders who have stayed with us through the
seven year period and we express our great appreciation to them.  
We owe a large part of our success to E Wood, the jewel in our crown  and, on your behalf, I pay particular tribute and express
our great appreciation to Chris McDonnell who has led the company since 1984, and his team. The financial results alone do not
do justice to the technical skills and entrepreneurial abilities that have produced them but they are a reminder of what British
manufacturing industry with the right products and management can achieve.

In the year ended 31 December 1999, just prior to our acquisition of the Meristem plc group, E Wood reported sales of  11
million and an operating profit of  1.3 million.  The equivalent figures for the year to December 2006, announced today are sales
of  27.1 million and an operating profit before central costs and amortisation of goodwill of  3.8 million - more than doubling
sales and nearly trebling the operating profit before central costs and goodwill amortisation.
Your Board believe that the E Wood business can continue its profitable growth during 2007 and beyond. However, we are still
a relatively small and narrowly focused group exposed to risks as well as opportunities.  We believe that joining with 3M with
its strong resources and internationally admired technical focus, enables the group to minimise the risks and grow the
opportunities more quickly and assuredly than we could on our own.
Your Board believe that the price offered by 3M is a fair one and have unanimously accepted the offer in respect of their own
shareholdings. We wish all employees success under the new ownership and are confident that E Wood will continue to grow.

30. POST BALANCE SHEET EVENT
In March 2007, E Wood Limited (E Wood ) sold its 55% shareholding in Thortex America Inc (TAI ) to the minority
shareholder. This move follows two years of trading losses in the subsidiary and is also designed to bring the nature of the
relationship with TAI in line with the vast majority of other Thortex distributors. Costs incurred of  49,000 in reaching this
agreement have not been provided in these financial statements as they were agreed after the balance sheet date.
The carrying values of TAI in the financial statements of the group and E Wood have been impaired to their respective
recoverable amounts.
