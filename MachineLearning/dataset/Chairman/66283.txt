Egdon Resources plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2009
The current year has been a challenging year 
for all exploration and production businesses 
and Egdon has not been an exception. 
We have had to manage reduced and 
fl uctuating oil and energy prices and an 
uncertain economic outlook. Our strategy 
to develop the business in this trading 
environment has been clear. We have focused 
our efforts on near term production and 
revenue generating projects, reduced our 
near term exploration expenditure, and 
carefully managed our cash resources. Whilst 
doing this we have always had an eye to the 
future and looked to position ourselves 
for growth. 
Financial
The Group recorded a loss for the period 
of  83,523 (2008: loss of  2,376,262 from 
continuing operations). This equates to a loss 
per share of 0.12p (2008: loss per share of 
3.52p from continuing operations).
The Group had sustained oil production 
throughout the year with oil sales of 
 880,127 (2008:  1,121,624) on volumes 
of 23,474 barrels (2008: 23,430 barrels).
The Group has no borrowings and has 
adopted a strategy designed to provide 
a clear focus on managing costs. The Group 
had net current assets as at 31 July 2009 
of  1.50 million (2008:  2.29 million).
The Directors do not recommend the 
payment of a dividend (2008:  nil).
Near term focus on production
We have continued to focus the Company's 
resources on production and development 
projects designed to increase production and 
revenues. Production during the period was 
23,474 barrels slightly up from 2008 (23,430 
barrels). At 31 July 2009 the Keddington and 
Avington oil fi elds were on production.
Production from the Keddington oil fi eld in 
Lincolnshire continued throughout the period, 
with net Egdon oil volumes for the year of 
13,476 barrels an increase of 24% over 2008 
levels (10,866 barrels). We remain encouraged 
by the upside at Keddington and are planning 
to drill a sidetrack of the Keddington 2y well 
based on recently reprocessed 3D seismic 
data to increase production and revenues 
from the fi eld by early 2010.
The Avington oil fi eld was placed on 
production on 23 January 2009 and continued 
to produce until the end of the year. 
During March 2009 Egdon increased its 
interest in Avington from 20% to 36.667% 
through the acquisition of YCI Resources 
Limited (later renamed Egdon Resources 
Avington Limited) from Heyco Energy Group 
for a consideration of 6,861,434 Egdon 
ordinary shares and a Net Profi t Interest on 
production from the fi eld. Net production 
from Avington for the period was 9,998 
barrels (2008: 12,564 barrels). In early August 
2009 the fi eld was shut-in for a period of 
around two months whilst the permanent 
production facilities were upgraded.
During the year Egdon acquired the 
Kirklington-2 well site in Nottinghamshire 
(PEDL203) from Star Energy. The Kirklington 
oil fi eld, which had been shut-in since 2004, 
is located immediately to the south of 
the Eakring-Dukes Wood oil fi eld. 
The production facilities on the site have been 
reinstated and improved; test-production 
was initiated on 28 July 2009 and by 7 August 
2009 had achieved a rate of around 30 bopd. 
This production whilst welcome is not the 
primary interest for the Company. Egdon has 
identifi ed the potential to recover additional 
oil volumes via a sidetrack of the existing 
Kirklington-2 well. Planning approval is already 
in place for this well which will be drilled in the 
near future. 
Drilling activity was limited during the period 
as we consolidated activity around existing 
projects. However the Dukes Wood-1 well 
was spudded on 18 November 2008 with the 
drilling of the top-hole section of the well to a 
depth of 47 metres. This enabled the licence 
to be extended into its second term. Dukes 
Wood-1, which is due to complete drilling in 
November 2009, will test the highest part of 
the Dukes Wood anticline in an area where 
Egdon has identifi ed potential for un-drained 
and re-migrated oil. This is the fi rst well in the 
evaluation of the rejuvenation potential of the 
Eakring-Dukes Wood oil fi eld where we see 
low risk opportunities to add production and 
reserves to our near term asset base. 
The Kirkleatham gas fi eld development 
(PEDL068) continued, albeit with slower 
than hoped for progress. A milestone was 
achieved in August 2009 with the award 
of planning consent for the development. 
However, this project has not been immune 
from the recession with signifi cant changes 
on the Wilton site leading to delays in 
fi nalising the design and agreements. As a 
result the joint venture partners have agreed 
to move the target completion of the project 
from late winter 2009/10 to the start of the 
2010 winter gas season where it is anticipated 
that gas prices will be higher compared to a 
summer start-up. 
Acquisitions and asset transactions
In addition to the acquisition of YCI Resources 
Limited detailed above, Egdon also sold 
a minority interest of 10% in PEDL005 
(Remainder) to Alba Resources Limited 
for a cash consideration of  260,000 in 
January 2009.
On 23 September 2009 the Company 
announced it was in advanced negotiations to 
acquire a portfolio of UK and French assets 
from EnCore Oil plc (EnCore ). The assets 
to be acquired would consist of EnCore's 
entire interests in ten onshore UK licences, 
two onshore French licences and an interest 
in the Ceres gas fi eld located in the Southern 
North Sea. The Ceres fi eld is due to 
commence production prior to year end 
and on the basis of our expectation that the 
acquisition will complete around the end of 
2009 this would therefore contribute to the 
Company's production target.
On 15 October 2009 the Company 
announced that it had farmed-down its 
interest in four East Midlands licences to 
Terrain Energy Limited for a consideration 
of  687,500, with  450,000 payable in cash 
on completion and a further  237,500 
payable on a staged basis on commencement 
of specifi c drilling activity on licences 
PEDL005(Remainder), PEDL1 18 and 
PEDL203.

Exploration - the engine for growth
Egdon's strategy is to develop a high-potential 
exploration portfolio as a platform for future 
growth. Egdon has an objective of drilling 
three to four exploration and appraisal wells 
per year from 2010 onwards to achieve 
this goal. 
As part of the exploration process we 
continue to add value to our existing licences 
in the UK and France through detailed 
ongoing technical work, where we high-grade 
areas and prospects and look to secure the 
necessary landowner and planning consents 
for future drilling. We are currently awaiting 
the outcome of a planning application for the 
Holmwood prospect in Surrey and are 
preparing or considering planning applications 
for wells at Nooks Farm, Winfrith, North 
Somercotes and Westerdale. As part of the 
normal cycle of exploration we also relinquish 
those licences which do not meet our 
exacting technical standards. During the 
period PEDL's 048, 094, 128 and 132 have 
been relinquished and the past costs 
written off.
France has been a key focus for the 
Company's exploration strategy and it is 
pleasing to report the addition of two further 
high-potential permits during the year 
which add signifi cantly to the Company's 
opportunity base.
The fi rst of these, the Pontenx Permit is 
located on the southern margins of the 
Parentis Basin, an oil productive region on the 
Atlantic coast of France. The Pontenx Permit 
contains a mix of opportunities including the 
abandoned Mimizan Nord heavy oil fi eld and 
a number of high-potential prospects. 
The second of these is the Gex Permit which 
is located in the Jura/Molasse Basin adjacent to 
the Swiss Border. We are encouraged by its 
potential for signifi cant gas reserves close to 
Geneva, an area of major energy demand. 
We are also currently awaiting the award of 
a further French licence; Navacelle.
Egdon has reported best estimate prospective 
resources as at 31 July 2009 of 280 million 
barrels of oil equivalent in over 50 prospects. 
With this high number of prospects we have 
decided to market a number of farm-out 
opportunities with the aim of managing risk 
and accelerating drilling activity on some key 
projects. The farm-out market is currently 
very competitive but we hope to be able to 
report progress in this area during the 
coming year.
The Company will continue to review new 
exploration opportunities and apply for new 
projects where they strengthen our portfolio. 
Outlook
The Company has previously reported a 
production target of 500 boepd by the end 
of 2009. The delay in fi rst production from 
Kirkleatham will impact this target but planned 
activity at Dukes Wood, Keddington and 
Kirklington will add to overall production and 
combined with the proposed acquisition of 
Ceres from EnCore we expect to reach the 
target either by the end of 2009 or in 
early 2010
Looking further ahead the next 12 months 
will see further progress towards increasing 
production and revenues with continued 
production expected from Keddington, 
Avington and Kirklington and further 
production volumes anticipated from activity 
at Dukes Wood, Keddington, Waddock Cross 
and Kirkleatham.
A return to exploration activity is expected 
in the next year with potential wells at 
Winfrith, North Somercotes, Goudhurst and 
Holmwood dependent upon the outcome 
of planning applications. 
The challenges of the current trading 
environment can produce interesting 
acquisition opportunities and Egdon continues 
to review options to grow the business. 
As mentioned above, we anticipate 
completion of the EnCore acquisition and 
integration of this portfolio into Egdon's asset 
base around the end of 2009. This would 
result in additional drilling activity in Southern 
England and France in 2010.
Meanwhile we thank our shareholders for 
their continued patience and support, and 
I would like also to pay tribute to the hard 
work and endeavours of our staff during 
the year.
