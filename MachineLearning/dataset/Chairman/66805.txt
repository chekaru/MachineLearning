 Eleco plc  |  Annual Report and Accounts 2012
8
I will comment separately on the performance 
of ElecoBuild
 
, ElecoSoft
 
, and the Eleco 
Group. For ease of comparison, the 
comparative figures shown are those for the 
12-month period ended 31 December 2011.
ElecoSoft
 
ElecoSoft
 
 maintained its profitability in the year 
under review, which was a resilient performance 
given the general weakness in the construction 
markets. I am also pleased to say that 
ElecoSoft
 
 has begun the current year well.
Turnover of ElecoSoft
 
 in the year under 
review amounted to  15.8m (2011:  16.2m) 
of which recurring maintenance revenue 
amounted to  6,972,000 (2011:  7,016,000). 
The weakness of Sterling against both the 
Euro and the Swedish Kronor in 2011, when 
compared with 2012, accounted for the 
marginal reduction in both turnover and 
recurring maintenance revenue. 
EBITDA was higher at  2.2m (2011:  2.0m). 
Operating profit for the year ended 
31 December 2012 amounted to  2.0m 
(2011:  1.9m) before exceptional costs 
of  152,000 (2011:  nil) related principally 
to redundancy costs. The cost of software 
product development in the year under 
review was  2.1m of which  2.0m was 
written off as incurred, the same as last year. 
Outlook for ElecoSoft
 
 
ElecoSoft
 
 has made a good start in 2013. 
It will be launching a number of new software 
programs during the course of the year, 
including the launch in Germany of ArConNG, 
the next generation of its leading ArCon 
3D Architectural Software, and an iPad 
version of ElecoSoft
 
's o2c
 
  3D compression 
and visualisation software. ElecoSoft
 
 recently 
acquired the Wagemeyer
 
 stair software 
brand, which will be exhibited with Consultec
 
's 
StairCon
 
 software at the LIGNA Fair in 
Hannover. The acquisition of Wagemeyer 
will strengthen Consultec
 
's already strong 
position in the European stair software market.
ElecoSoft
 
's leading brands now include: 
 B Consultec
 
, StairCon
 
 BidCon
 
 StatCon
 
 
ElecoM@trix
 
 and SiteCon
 
, which are 
all developed in Sweden; 
 B Esign
 
, ArCon
 
; ArConNG
 
, Wagemayer
 
, 
and o2c
 
, all of which are developed 
in Germany; and 
 B the Asta Powerproject
 
 project 
management brand, which is 
developed in the United Kingdom. 
Details of these brands are set out in the 
Operating and Financial Review section of this 
report. As part of a BIM (Building Information 
Modelling) initiative, plans are also underway 
to allow ElecoSoft
 
's range of construction 
software products to exchange information 
with each other and third party products using 
an industry standard data format.
Despite challenging market conditions in 2012, 
ElecoSoft
 
's businesses in Germany delivered 
improved operating profits. In the UK, buyers 
were cautious, however a significant number 
of product licences were reactivated by larger 
clients indicating an increase in their project 
workload. In Sweden meanwhile, the 
demand for ElecoSoft
 
 products and 
services remained positive. 
In March 2013, ElecoSoft
 
 also opened an 
office in Bangalore, India, in response to the 
number of enquiries for its software programs 
that we received from that region. 
ElecoBuild
 
The continued contraction of the UK 
Construction Industry, and in particular that 
sector of the industry in which ElecoBuild
 
 
operates, meant that 2012 would inevitably 
be another difficult year. Poor trading led 
to further redundancies and downsizing 
of our precast concrete operations. 
Following the major downsizing last year, 
ElecoBuild
 
's precast concrete operations now 
comprise Bell & Webster Concrete, which is 
based in Grantham, Lincolnshire, and Milbury 
Systems, based in Lydney, Gloucestershire. 
Its building products operations now comprise 
SpeedDeck Building Systems, Downer 
Cladding, Stramit Panel Products and Prompt 
Profiles, all of which are based in Yaxley, Suffolk. 
Turnover of ElecoBuild
 
's continuing operations 
in the year under review amounted to  18.4m 
(2011:  22.9m), and reflects the elimination 
of our loss making precast custodial contract 
capacity, the sale of our Hoveringham concrete 
manufacturing plant, and the sale of our connector 
plate interests in the UK and South Africa.
The loss of ElecoBuild
 
's continuing operations 
in the year under review, before exceptional 
costs, was  1.2m (2011:  0.4m). Exceptional 
costs amounted to  1.1m (2011:  42,000), 
principally due to goodwill impairment of 
 0.6m (2011:  nil) and redundancy costs 
of  0.4m (2011:  42,000) relating to 
restructuring activities. 
Outlook for ElecoBuild
 
The atrocious mix of ice, snow, rain and wind 
experienced in the first quarter regrettably 
resulted in a poor start in 2013 for all of 
ElecoBuild
 
's operating units, the performance 
of which were below budget in the first quarter. 
However, Bell & Webster Concrete's orders are 
now significantly higher than they were at this 
time last year. Orders for Milbury Systems' 
standard concrete products are also higher. 
However, I regret to say that our Building 
Products businesses have yet to experience 
an improvement in trading conditions thus far. 
Eleco Group
Group Trading Summary
Group Turnover of Continuing Operations for 
the year under review amounted to  34.2m; 
(2011:  38.1m) with turnover of ElecoSoft
 
 
approaching that of ElecoBuild
 
.
 Chairman's Statement
 In the past five years our UK and international software interests have 
made good progress, have grown substantially in value and have been 
cash generative, while in the same period, our UK building systems 
businesses have experienced extraordinarily difficult trading.  9

Overview Financials Governance Business Review
Group Operating Losses from continuing 
operations for the year under review, before 
exceptional losses of  1.6m amounted 
to  290,000 (2011: profit  236,000, 
before exceptional losses of  130,000). 
Group continuing operations sustained a loss 
before tax in the period under review of  2.4m 
(2011:  0.3m) after Corporate Costs of  0.9m 
(2011:  1.0m) and exceptional costs of  1.6m 
(2011:  0.1m). Of the exceptional costs,  0.6m 
(2011:  0.1m) related mainly to redundancy 
costs from operational restructuring and  0.4m 
(2011:  nil) to Pension Scheme restructuring 
fees and expenses. Most of the remaining 
exceptional costs relate to goodwill impairment 
at ElecoBuild
 
,  0.6m (2011:  nil).
The Group loss after tax for the year was  2.7m. 
(2011:  2.1m) which is equivalent to a loss per 
share of 4.6p (2011: 3.6p loss per share).
Finance
The proceeds from the sale of the Hoveringham 
site together with the deferred consideration 
received from the sale of our connector 
plate businesses of  0.7m were allocated 
to ElecoBuild
 
. However, despite this and 
 1.3m of additional financial support provided 
to ElecoBuild
 
, Group bank borrowings at 
31 December 2012 of  7.4m were all 
attributable to activities related to ElecoBuild
 
. 
Group net bank borrowings on the same 
date amounted to  6.5m, after taking account 
of cash balances of  0.9m attributable to 
businesses that are part of ElecoSoft
 
. Group 
net bank borrowings at 28 February 2013 
were  6.4m compared with  6.4m at 
28 February 2012.
 800,000 of the consideration for the sale 
of Gang-Nail Systems and International Truss 
Systems will continue to be held in escrow 
until 16 December 2013. 
Disposals of assets and businesses, together 
with a reduction in capital expenditure and with 
cash generated from the profitable trading of 
our Software businesses, partially offset the 
adverse cash impact of the poor performance 
of our concrete and timber frame businesses. 
This outcome enabled the Group to restrict its 
net bank borrowings at 31 December 2012 to 
 6.5m (2011:  4.1m), despite having to finance 
the  595,000 cost of discharging a Section 75 
obligation to the Pension Scheme together with 
 375,000 of related professional costs and was 
expenditure that was clearly not incurred in the 
ordinary course of trading. 
Lloyds Banking Group renewed the Group's 
banking facilities with effect from 13 May 2013. 
The Directors are satisfied that the Group 
has sufficient working capital for its present 
requirements and as a consequence 
shareholders should be aware of the increase 
in the rates of interest charged by the Bank 
on our renewed facilities and the extent of the 
security required by the Bank and arrangement 
fees charged by the Bank in agreeing to these 
facilities, details of which are set out in the 
Operating and Financial Review section of 
this report.
In the light of the continuing trading pressures, 
which continue to be experienced by its 
ElecoBuild
 
 businesses, Eleco continues to 
moderate its investment in new capital projects. 
Capital investment for the year under review 
was reduced to  503,000 (2011:  1.0m), 
however I am pleased to report that software 
product development continued unabated 
at  2.1m (2011: 2.1m), of which  0.1m 
(2011:  0.1m) was capitalised.
Actions taken by the Board during 2012 to 
maintain the financial stability of the Group 
in a very difficult trading and financial climate, 
inevitably gave rise to a substantial increase 
in legal, banking and other professional fees, 
which doubled to  0.6m (2011:  0.3m). This 
is more than we were able to invest in capital 
equipment for our businesses. Unfortunately 
such costs impact both our trading 
performance and our cash resources. 
We anticipate that these pressures will ease 
as the Eleco Group achieves a full recovery.
Employees
On behalf of shareholders and the Board, I would 
like to thank all our employees for their hard work 
and dedication during the period under review. 
Implementing the above changes has placed 
very significant and stressful demands on them 
and unfortunately, 20 more employees became 
redundant in the downsizing of our building 
businesses during the year. 
Dividends
The Board does not propose to recommend 
the payment of a dividend in respect of the 
period under review. 
Outlook
In the past five years our UK and international 
software interests have made good progress, 
have grown substantially in value and have 
been cash generative, while in the same period, 
our UK building systems businesses have 
experienced extraordinarily difficult trading and 
have consumed substantial amounts of cash. 
This unbalanced the Group and placed it under 
considerable financial strain. 
However, I believe that the many difficult 
decisions that your Board has had to take 
to deal with this situation are now beginning 
to bear fruit and I am becoming increasingly 
confident that Eleco will arrive at a position 
from which, in the absence of unforeseen 
circumstances, it will be able to make a full 
recovery. I can assure you that I and all my 
colleagues will continue to do all we can 
to achieve this objective.
