 Chairman's report 
This is my first annual report as Chairman of Electrocomponents 
and I am delighted to have joined at such an exciting time.  
The past year has been one of record revenues and growing 
profitability. The Group has a clear strategy, strong business  
model and infrastructure to capture the significant structural 
growth opportunities that exist across its worldwide markets.  
Our strategy has enabled Electrocomponents to capitalise on the 
improving market conditions experienced over the past year and 
deliver a strong financial performance in 2011. Group revenues 
were  1,182m an underlying increase of 21%, headline profit 
before tax was  114m, an increase of 53% and headline earnings 
per share were 18.0 pence, an increase of 53%. The increase  
in profits was driven by double digit sales growth across all our 
regions combined with cost leverage as sales recovered.  
Performance over the past year has benefited from the  
continued implementation of the Group's strategic initiatives.  
The strategic development of the business during the year,  
and our strategy going forward, are covered in more detail in  
the Chief Executive's review. 
A number of important strategic milestones were reached in 2011 
including sales exceeding  1bn for the first time in the Group's 
history, the International business share of Group sales reaching 
70% and eCommerce representing over 50% of Group sales. 
The Board intends to recommend the payment of a final dividend 
of 6.5p per share to be paid on 22 July 2011 representing an 8% 
increase. As a result the total dividend for the financial year will  
be increased by 5% to 11.5p per share. 
We maintained a high level of pay out during the recession 
recognising the importance of dividends to shareholders. As a 
result of the strong financial performance of the business and  
our confidence in the Group's prospects, the Board is proposing to 
recommend an increased final dividend for the year. The business 
has significant opportunities to invest for growth and therefore we 
intend to maintain a strong balance sheet.  
Important strategic milestones were
reached in 2011 including sales  
exceeding  1bn for the first time.

Peter Johnson, Chairman
 
I am pleased to report that our company takes its responsibility  
to the many communities in which it operates very seriously. We 
have a strong focus on the health and safety of all our employees 
and a strategy to ensure their full engagement in the business. 
Electrocomponents is a member of the FTSE4Good index and in 
the UK we are a  Standard Bearer' for the Carbon Trust. This year 
we became a Patron of the National Society for the Prevention  
of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) in the UK thanks to our employee 
payroll donation programme and regular charitable events. 
In my first year I have been fortunate to travel around much of the 
Group and meet many of our employees and what I have found 
has truly impressed me. There is a tremendous appetite amongst 
our people to embrace challenge and a desire to exceed our 
customers' needs. There are numerous examples I could cite of 
this tremendous spirit, but I was particularly struck by our Allied 
business in North America; it is a great example of a committed, 
customer focused and sales-led business. Similarly, what has been 
achieved by the European region in restructuring the leadership 
into a single management team in a matter of months was 
impressive and the results speak for themselves, sales growth  
in excess of 20% and high employee engagement scores. I am 
also very pleased with the commitment of the UK team which 
delivered double digit sales growth and contribution over  100m 
for the year, now above pre-recession levels. 
As well as reporting excellent results, the business has  
addressed many challenges and interruptions. These included 
earthquakes in New Zealand and Northern Japan, floods in 
Australia and snowstorms in the UK. Throughout these testing 
times, the response by our employees has been magnificent. 
During March, our Japanese business continued to operate and 
meet our customers' needs despite the enormous logistical and 
infrastructure challenges caused by the earthquake. All of our  
130 employees there should be applauded for their  can do' 
attitude and they are a tremendous credit to the Japanese spirit.  
I am pleased to have joined a strong and effective Board which  
has a clear view of its own role and purpose. On their behalf,  
I would like to thank my predecessor, Helmut Mamsch who 
chaired Electrocomponents from September 2006 to 2010 and 
especially for his calm stewardship of the business in the severe 
recession. We all wish him well. 
Finally, and on behalf of the Electrocomponents Board, may  
I extend our gratitude to all employees for delivering this year's 
strong financial performance.   Electrocomponents plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 5
