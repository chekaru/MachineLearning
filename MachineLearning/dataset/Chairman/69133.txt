Introduction
I am pleased to report another improvement in profitability in the year ended 31 March 2013, with Diffusion's 
sales 6 per cent ahead of last year at  7.55 million and Group profit before tax 16 per cent ahead of last year at 
 200,000. This profit improvement was in line with management's expectations and was achieved in a continuation 
of challenging trading conditions within the UK construction industry.
Diffusion's markets did not show any signs of growth during the year and selling price pressure remained a market 
feature. The Company produced this profit improvement through increased sales, by maintaining Diffusion's 
premium branding market position and pursuing quality jobs likely to return target selling margins, combined with 
focused business development activities.
Group trading performance
Sales in the year ended 31 March 2013 increased by 6 per cent to 
 7.55 million (2012:  7.09 million). Increased sales were achieved 
for both fan coils and commercial heating products. Fan coils had a 
particularly strong year and were installed into a number of large London 
based developments, including the Shard Building, the Cheesegrater and 
375 Kensington High Street.
The sales and marketing function was strengthened during the year 
producing extra sales to more than counteract the market led marginal 
softening of selling margins. The increased sales and relatively fixed cost 
base resulted in Diffusion's operating profit increasing by 19 per cent to 
 406,000. This operating profit margin of 5.4 percent represented a high 
return on Diffusion's capital employed (ROCE ) of 28 per cent. 
Central and plc costs were  164,000 (2012:  130,000) and interest 
costs amounted to  42,000 (2012:  40,000). Central and plc costs 
include a non-cash share option charge and other non-recurring costs. 
Included under interest costs are notional interest charges of  16,000 
(2012:  14,000) relating to the unwinding of the provision set up at 
31 March 2010.
The resulting Group profit before tax on Continuing Operations increased 
by 16 per cent to  200,000 (2012:  173,000). The taxation charge of 
 39,000 (2012: 25,000) represents a non-cash write off of the deferred 
tax asset.

About Diffusion
With over 50 years in the heating and ventilation industry (HVAC ), the Company's operating subsidiary Diffusion 
is one of the oldest and most established manufacturers of HVAC products in the UK. Diffusion is a market leader 
in the manufacture of premium quality fan coils and commercial heating products. Diffusion and Energy Technique 
are brand names recognised as highly engineered, quality products providing leading edge performance and 
energy efficiency.
Diffusion's products are installed into hotels, commercial offices, retail outlets, schools, hospitals, and more recently 
high-end residential. Diffusion has excellent relationships with many blue chip clients including Land Securities, 
Marks & Spencer, Boots, City Inn Hotels, and Stanhope Properties. All products are designed, developed and 
manufactured at Diffusion's 30,000 sq. ft. manufacturing facility in West Molesey, Surrey, offering premium quality 
products, designed specifically to meet customers' bespoke requirements.
Diffusion's operating performance
This is the third successive year of sales and profit growth for Diffusion. Sales growth was achieved for both fan 
coils and commercial heating products: fan coils by 8 per cent and commercial heating by 5 per cent. Sales 
growth resulted from a reorganisation of the sales and marketing functions. 
Fan coils were installed into a number of landmark developments 
including the Shard Building, Cheesegrater, Google HQ Dublin, Abu 
Dhabi Investment Bank, John Lewis and Jaynes Harbour Barbados. After 
the year end, Diffusion also won the first phase to supply fan coils into the 
Walkie-Talkie building. This means that Diffusion has supplied fan coils 
into all three of the current London skyline developments. 
Following on from the success of installing fan coils into the high-end 
residential development at No. 1 Hyde Park in London, Diffusion has 
now supplied fan coils into other high-end residential developments 
including 375 Kensington High Street, DeVere Gardens and the Battersea 
redevelopment scheme. The Board expects further sales growth from this 
high-end residential sector.
Commercial heating enjoys the same reputation for engineering quality 
as Diffusion's fan coils and customers like the short lead times, combined 
with a specialist bespoke service. The growth in commercial heating sales 
was a commendable effort achieved in weak retail market conditions. 
Diffusion's commercial heating products were installed into many 
prestigious projects including Broadgate Tower, 2 Waterhouse Square, 
Serpentine Gallery (London), Starbucks (Canary Wharf) and MTV Studios 
(London). 
A number of new sales initiatives have recently been launched, including 
the appointment of a seasoned HVAC industry professional as Business 
Development Director. The new eco-friendly 270 range of fan coils was 
launched in April 2013 offering energy savings of up to 25 per cent over 
existing fan coils and a new CRM database system for tracking order 
prospects goes live in July 2013. All of these initiatives are expected to 
contribute to Diffusion's future growth strategy.

Cash flow and net cash
Cash generated by operations increased by 170 per cent to  492,000 (2012:  182,000) with the Group having 
net cash equivalents at 31 March 2013 of  590,000 (2012:  237,000). The Group is soundly financed with 
this level of liquidity and net assets at 31 March 2013 of  1.53 million, equivalent to 46 pence per share. Cash 
generated during the year benefited from the absence of hire purchase instalments on the Trumpf laser cutter after 
May 2012, when the last payment was made. 
Capital expenditure 
Capital expenditure during the year was modest at  27,000, comprising further investment in the Group's IT 
infrastructure and CRM database systems. This is not a capital intensive business and the main items of future 
capital expenditure will largely comprise replacement expenditure only. 
Dividends
The Board recommends payment of a final dividend of 0.75 pence per share, payable on 30 August 2013 to 
shareholders on the share register on 2 August 2013. The Company paid an interim dividend of 0.75 pence per 
share in December 2012, taking total dividends for the year ended 31 March 2013 to 1.5 pence per share. At a 
share price of 60 pence per share, this is equivalent to a dividend yield of 2.5 per cent. 
General meeting on 16 May 2013
At the General Meeting of shareholders held on 16 May 2013, shareholders approved the resolution to buy back 
up to 940,000 shares at 42.5 pence from its then largest shareholder, Elsina Limited, on the terms set out in the 
Circular to shareholders dated 23 April 2013. In accordance with the terms of the Buy-Back agreement, 470,000 
shares were bought back after the General Meeting, for a consideration of  200,000. The remaining 470,000 
shares are subject to two call options. 
Business strategy
The Board's strategy is to build on the success of the last two years and to continue to grow Diffusion's sales and 
profits organically. The Board does not consider shareholders' best interests will be served by evaluating merger 
and acquisition opportunities at the present time. Once the Board has achieved its strategic objective of growing 
Diffusion's sales and profits organically, then it will seek a strategic partnership so as to fully realise shareholder 
value. 
At a share price of 60 pence per share, the Company's market capitalisation of  1.72 million represents a low 
multiple of 4.2 times Diffusion's operating profit for the year ended 31 March 2013. The Board believes this 
represents an opportunity to enhance shareholder value in line with its organic growth strategy for Diffusion. 
Current trading and prospects
Trading in the current year ending 31 March 2014 has started very well, with sales in April and May 2013 in line 
with management's expectations. In addition, enquiry levels for quality projects are encouraging and the order 
book is at very acceptable levels, recently bolstered by winning the first phase of fan coils for the Walkie-Talkie 
development. 
The Company has high expectations for its new eco-friendly 270 range of fan coils launched in April 2013. Whilst 
the Company's markets are not expected to change materially in the coming financial year, the Board looks 
forward to another year of successful growth.
