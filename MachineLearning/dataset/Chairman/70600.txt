 Letter to Shareholders
eq group plc - Annual Report and Accounts 08
Dear Shareholders,
Our third full year of trading, 2003, was a very
positive year for your company. We achieved all the
financial and operational objectives stated in last
year's statement to you our shareholders. As a
result growth in revenue, headline profits and
earnings per share were well above the relevant
market sector averages. 
Group turnover increased by 73% to  8,911,000
(2002:  5,151,000). Revenue from continuing
operations (on a pro forma basis) increased by 22%
to  8,425,000 as a result of strong organic growth
at Qu stor, Buckingham and The Lead Agency. 
Adjusted operating profit before amortisation of
goodwill and exceptional items increased by 99%
to  1,319,000 (2002:  663,000). Amortisation of
goodwill, which has no cash impact but relates to the
goodwill associated with previous acquisitions, was
 335,000 (2002:  260,000). Operating profit
increased by 144% to  984,000 (2002:  403,000).
Exceptional items associated with the disposal of
TVI amounted to  30,000. 
Adjusted basic earnings per share before amortisation
of goodwill and exceptional items were up 87%, at
10.08 pence (2002: 5.39 pence), their highest level
since the group was formed in March 2000. Basic
earnings per share increased by 391% to 4.87 pence
from 0.99 pence. 
Adjusted fully diluted earnings per share before
amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items were
up 72%, to 9.26 pence (2002: 5.38 pence). Fully
diluted earnings per share increased by 351% to
4.47 pence from 0.99 pence. 
The reported profit before tax was  634,000 (2002:
 132,000) and profit after tax increased by 475% to
 339,000 from  59,000.
We generated a net cash inflow from our operations,
after interest, tax payments and capital expenditure,
of  1,248,000, an improvement of  1,539,000 on
last year. This contributed to net debt decreasing by
18.3%, to  5,399,000 (2002:  6,610,000). Interest
cover before amortisation of goodwill increased to
over 4.1 times, up from 2.5 times in 2002. Your board
is comfortable that this level of debt is appropriate
for an acquisitive business that has been advancing
under the combined conditions of low interest rates
and weak equity markets.

NAME: Tony Isaacs
OCCUPATION: Research Director
COMPANY: Buckingham Research Associates Limited
LOCATION: Cookham, Berkshire Year Ended 31 December 2003 09

Before joining BRA in 2001, Tony had worked in some of the UK's top marketing
companies. He brought to us many years experience of data analysis, market research,
database marketing and communications planning, but decided to focus on his passion for
data analysis and modelling. He heads the Advanced Analytics team, all mathematicians
who use statistical methods to help clients learn more from their data. He pioneered the
development of Spark, an advanced, highly accurate non-linear data modelling tool used
in market segmentation and brand driver analysis.

Information Services and Consulting 
Qu stor performed exceptionally well during its
first full year within the group. Revenue increased by
16% and operating profits increased by 48% on a
pro forma basis. The greatest challenge during the
year was delivering the volume of work that was
commissioned without compromising on quality. We
would like to express our thanks to the Qu stor
team for rising to this challenge particularly during
the peak workload months in the summer.
Buckingham Research also produced a strong
performance largely as a result of greater focus on
business development by the whole team. In last
year's Annual Report to shareholders we stated that a
key challenge for 2003 was to broaden Buckingham's
customer base and thereby minimise sectoral and
customer concentration concerns. In 2003 revenues
from new clients amounted to  409,667 or 19% of
revenue, a like-for-like increase of 234% on 2002.
In combination, Qu stor and Buckingham increased
like-for-like operating profits by 52.8% and revenues
by 20.1% against the same period in 2002 (on a pro
forma basis). This compares favourably to growth in
the market research industry as a whole where
revenues amongst the Top 80 UK agencies increased
by 4.2% in 2002. Operating margins were 16.0%
across the two businesses, up from 12.8% in 2002
on a pro forma basis. 103 credentials presentations
were undertaken during the period and 62 new
clients were won. Qu stor and Buckingham won six
international projects by combining their respective
skills and industry knowledge.
Marketing Communications
The Lead Agency contributed  323,852 or 4% of
the continuing group's revenues in its first full year
within the group, which is an excellent achievement
given that it was acquired on 20 December 2002 as
a recently established operation. Operating margins
averaged 30.2% in a period of very high growth and
headcount increased to ten by the year end. 
During a period of intensive business development
The Lead Agency team conducted 92 credentials
presentations resulting in 21 new client wins with
organisations including Sony, Sun Microsystems,
Crystal Decisions and Information Builders. The Lead
Agency conducted three joint projects with Qu stor
and has undertaken a series of business development
projects for Buckingham Research.
Support Services
Like-for-like revenues at Broadnet were down by
6% during the period. The first half of the year was
tough for commercial radio stations in the UK which
resulted in station closures, the sale of stations to
non-Broadnet customers and price pressure. Trading
conditions in the UK improved during the second half
of the year as radio advertising spend picked up and
remained buoyant in the Irish market.

During the course of the year Broadnet won 12 new
licence contracts and significant progress was made
on the new version of Broadnet's market-leading
radio traffic management software.
Summary of Activities
eq continues to build a first class customer base.
During 2003 we worked with 270 companies, up
from 221 in 2002 (on continuing operations). Our
Top 20 clients accounted for 53% of group revenues
with the largest accounting for 8%. Of these, 45%
were FTSE-100 constituents, 5% were FTSE-250
constituents, 10% were S&P 500 constituents, 15%
were smaller publicly quoted companies and the
remaining 25% were privately held businesses. By
sector, our most significant markets were Financial
Services (25%), Fast Moving Consumer Goods (20%)
and Media (20%).
Our greatest asset and point of difference continues to
be our people. During the course of the year we hired
some exceptional talent to meet both the increased
workload and expected growth levels. Our ongoing
challenge is to ensure that we develop and stimulate
our team of talented individuals, whilst also expanding
it to support further growth. During 2003 our team
grew by 53 to 101 people, largely as a result of the
acquisitions of Qu stor and The Lead Agency. 
Collaboration between the businesses in the group
resulted in nine projects being won with a total inter-
company value of  136,808 and a total project value
of  272,826. Qu stor and Buckingham Research
worked together on a number of international
projects where Qu stor would ordinarily have
sub-contracted fieldwork to third parties. The Lead
Agency worked with Buckingham Research on a
series of demand creation campaigns and Qu stor
provided telephone interviewing services to The Lead
Agency to meet peaks in demand. 
In a year when we consolidated our position and
achieved strong organic growth, we also reviewed 87
potential acquisition targets. This number is lower
than we have reported in previous years because we
took the decision to exclude US businesses from our
search and we maintained our stringent acquisition
criteria. The fourth quarter saw dealflow improve
significantly and as a result we have entered 2004 with
a healthy pipeline of high quality acquisition targets.
Outlook
We remain positive about our prospects for 2004 and
beyond. Like-for-like revenues in January are more
than 50% up on 2003 and our pipeline for the first
quarter is very healthy. Account reviews of our major
customers suggest that demand for our expertise
remains buoyant and that budgets are at least
consistent with 2003. Our customer base continues
to expand and diversify with a number of positive
wins in the first few weeks of 2004.
From an economic perspective, unemployment and
inflation remain low and whilst interest rates may not
remain at current levels we believe consumer

Letter to Shareholders (continued)
confidence will continue to hold firm. This should, in
turn, have a positive impact on the key sectors that
we operate in. 
The much discussed impact of the combined US
Presidential election and the European Football
Championships is more likely to impact those
involved in advertising, however it is possible that
we may see a temporary increase in demand as
companies seek to launch products in advance of
the championships or evaluate sponsorship during
the course of the competition.
At present our acquisition pipeline looks very positive
with a number of well qualified prospects under
review or in negotiation, however there is no
guarantee that any of these opportunities will
progress to completion. As we look forward to 2004,
we will pursue these and new opportunities with
gusto whilst continuing to take our sensible and now
familiar approach to new acquisitions. 
Finally, we would like to thank all of our employees
who have worked tirelessly during this highly
successful but nonetheless challenging year. With this
level of commitment and the exciting opportunities
that lie ahead, we are sure that the group will make
further significant progress during the current year.
