 Executive Chairman's Statement
Filtronic plc Annual Report 2003 2
Financial results
Sales for the year ended 31 May 2003 were  241.3m (2002  280.5m). Operating profit before exceptional
costs, goodwill amortisation, and share compensation costs was  11.0m (2002  17.8m).
After charging exceptional costs of  1.8m, goodwill amortisation of  2.3m, share compensation costs of
 0.2m, and net interest and financing currency costs of  2.9m, the profit before tax was  3.8m
(2002  25.5m loss). After tax, this was  1.1m (2002  29.0m loss), resulting in basic earnings per share of
1.46p (2002 39.31p basic loss), which is 1.45p on a diluted basis (2002 39.31p loss).
Net interest and financing currency costs have fallen to  2.9m from  12.5m in 2002. This is partly due
to lower levels of net interest payable which reduced to  8.0m from  12.6m in 2002 as a result of buying
in $37.2m of 10% Senior Notes during the year. Additionally, a net financing currency exchange gain of
 4.2m (2002  0.1m) has arisen on the 10% Senior Notes and an exceptional net gain of  0.9m (2002  nil) was realised
on buying in the Senior Notes at a discount to par value.
Cash
At 31 May 2003, Filtronic had a cash balance of  6.5m, having generated  19.5m of cash during the financial year.
Filtronic's debt was $103.6m ( 63.2m) of 10% Senior Notes, after using  22.1m of cash to buy in $37.2m of 10% Senior
Notes. Additionally, the company continues to have bank borrowing facilities totalling  31.0m, none of which was being
utilised at the year end. Net gearing was 51%, compared to 81% at 31 May 2002. 
Dividend
The Board is proposing to maintain the final dividend of 1.8p (2002 1.8p) payable on 3 November 2003 to shareholders
on the register at 15 August 2003.

Wireless Infrastructure
Market conditions have been characterised by strong pricing pressure in 2G and 2.5G systems and low levels of demand
for 3G WCDMA products. As a result, both sales and operating margins in this business segment declined. Although the
larger operations in the UK and the USA continued to achieve our target operating margins, low levels of 3G WCDMA
demand adversely impacted performance in our Finnish and Australian operations. Overall, Filtronic continued to
outperform its competitors and remains the number one independent supplier of its type in the world. Continued focus
on customer support, cost reductions and operating efficiency will remain at the forefront of this business segment's
strategy.
Cellular Handset Products
The Cellular Handset Products business had another outstanding year. During the financial year, Filtronic supplied
approximately 106 million handset antennas, an increase of 23% over the previous financial year. Over one third of
these units were manufactured in Suzhou, China. Several Far Eastern handset manufacturers have been added as
customers during the year, although to date they have not accounted for material levels of sales.
Electronic Warfare
The Electronic Warfare business segment finished the financial year strongly after a disappointing first half. The
business was profitable, and increasingly so, in each of the last four months of the financial year, reflecting the
increasing volumes of production in the European Fighter Aircraft programme, alongside strong demand for certain
products in the USA.
Broadband Access
The Broadband Access business continued to suffer from low levels of demand for its current point to point transceiver
products resulting in continuing losses. New high performance, lower cost, monolithic microwave integrated circuits
(MMICs ) from Newton Aycliffe have been designed and are expected to be introduced during the second half of the
next financial year, which should assist in improving financial performance in this business segment.
Compound Semiconductors
Throughout the year, focus has been maintained on developing and qualifying the compound semiconductor processes
at our state of the art facility at Newton Aycliffe. As I stated in my Interim Statement in January 2003, our agreement
for foundry sales with M/A-COM, Inc., has not proved fruitful. As a result, we have developed a new proprietary switch
process and sample product has been supplied to several major potential customers for mobile handset and wireless
LAN market applications. In addition, an innovative process for the manufacture of very high power transistors has
been developed for the base station power amplifier market. These transistors are essential to meet the high efficiency
requirements of our power amplifier development. The MMIC process has been used to supply initial quantities of
product to BAE SYSTEMS Avionics Ltd and other customers, including internal requirements in the Broadband Access
business. These products address both the defence and wireless communications markets.
Filtronic Solid State, California
Last year, the Board announced the closure of the fabrication facility for compound semiconductors at Filtronic Solid
State, Santa Clara, California. The exceptional closure costs amounted to  1.8m,  0.9m lower than the estimate made in
the half year results to 30 November 2002. The compound semiconductor team at Filtronic Solid State is now operating
as a  fabless' compound semiconductor business using the manufacturing capability at Newton Aycliffe.
Filtronic plc Annual Report 2003 3 Executive Chairman's Statement
Outlook
The Board expects that the group will continue to generate cash and reduce indebtedness during the financial year
ending 31 May 2004.
Worldwide demand for mobile infrastructure products continued to decline during the past year with few signs of an
imminent upturn. Independent forecasts indicate a further decline in the range of 10% to 20% in this market in 2003.
Notwithstanding these challenging market conditions, Filtronic has continued to consolidate its position as the world's
leading independent supplier of transmit/receive modules for mobile base stations. Despite pricing pressures and
difficult markets, the Board remains confident in the medium and long term opportunities offered by the wireless
communications markets, including 3G, for both the company's existing and new products including high performance
power amplifiers.
Filtronic is one of the world's leading manufacturers of mobile handset antennas and supplies over 25% of the world
demand. The world market for mobile handsets is independently forecast to show an approximate 10% year on year
unit growth in 2003. The Board expects Filtronic to maintain its market position in this business segment in the
financial year ending 31 May 2004.
The Electronic Warfare business is characterised by long development cycles and requires demanding technical
performance. Filtronic has now entered the production phase for several qualified products on a number of major
programmes, which should provide sustainable, profitable growth over a number of years.
Considerable pressure exists to develop and produce more sophisticated and cost effective solutions in the mobile
telecommunications industry. For the last three years our major research and development effort has been aimed
specifically at 3G base station equipment. At the heart of the new products are the compound semiconductor
transistors manufactured at Newton Aycliffe, which are embedded in proprietary circuits to provide high power
(360 Watts peak) very efficiently. Following the successful demonstration of this technology to several Original
Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), customer specific 3G power amplifier requirements are now being addressed using
internally developed advanced digital linearisation techniques. These customer specific sample units will be delivered to
at least four major OEMs over the next few months. Other market demands have led us to develop a larger range of
compound semiconductor products at Newton Aycliffe with an increased urgency to introduce multifunction MMICs
for both the commercial and defence sectors. Our developments at Newton Aycliffe position Filtronic to take advantage
of a wide range of compound semiconductor related market opportunities as they arise.
Overall, our two main businesses are expected at least to maintain their market position. In addition, the Electronic
Warfare business is now growing and profitable. The range of products and processes, particularly at Newton Aycliffe,
has been expanded to provide a platform for growth.
