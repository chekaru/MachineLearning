Financials
t hese final results are the Company's first final results to be 
reported in accordance with international Financial r eporting 
Standards (iFr S ) and the comparative financial information  
for the year ended 31 December 2006 has been restated 
accordingly. t he percentages given within this report are 
calculated using the restated financial information for the year 
ended 31 December 2006. t he impact of adopting iFr S is 
disclosed within the n otes to the Financial information section of 
this report and additional information is also available on the 
Company's website at www.globalenergyplc.com. 
t urnover for the year ended 31 December 2007 was $27.3 
million, an increase of 29.6% against the prior year (year ended 
31 December 2006: $21.1 million) due to higher oil prices, 
marginally increased oil production volumes and income relating 
to a quality adjustment. t otal cost of sales was $13.5 million (year 
ended 31 December 2006: $11.6 million) and gross profit was 
$13.8 million (year ended 31 December 2006: $9.5 million). 
o perating profit was $9.9 million (year ended 31 December 
2006: $5.2 million) with profit before tax (excluding correction of 
miscellaneous income) (see note 4 of n otes to Financial 
information) at $7.6 million (year ended 31 December 2006: 
$4.7 million).
Gross production for the year ended 31 December 2007 totalled 
478,030 barrels of oil (bbls ) (year ended 31 December 2006: 
466,099 bbls) with production net to the Company of 413,775 
bbls (year ended 31 December 2006: 401,298 bbls). t he 
average price for West t exas intermediate (Wti  ) crude oil 
during 2007 was $72.48 (2006: $66.23) and the Company 
averaged an operating cash netback per barrel of oil (excluding 
miscellaneous income and income relating to a quality 
adjustment) of $30.44 (2006: $23.86). t he Company's lease 
and operating expense (loe  ) per barrel of oil equivalent 
(boe  ) in 2007 was 6.5% lower than in 2006 due to increased 
operational efficiencies and despite rising industry costs. 
n et cash inflow from operating activities for the year ended 31 
December 2007 was $12.4 million (year ended 31 December 
2006: $8.9 million) and this together with available cash funded 
capital expenditure of $13.3 million (year ended 31 December 
2006: $15.2 million). 
2007 reserve report
r yder Scott, the petroleum consultancy firm, has independently 
audited the Company's portfolio of contracts and prepared a 
reserve report for the Company annually since the Company's 
admission to Aim in 2002. 
r yder Scott reported that as at 31 December 2007, proved 
reserves net to the Company totalled 4.6 million boe (as at 31 
December 2006: 5.5 million boe ), proved plus probable (2p ) 
reserves net to the Company totalled 15.2 million boe (as at 31 
December 2006: 19.4 million boe ) and proved plus probable 
plus possible (3p ) reserves net to the Company totalled 64.9 
million boe (as at 31 December 2006: 81.8 million boe ).
based upon a brent Crude o il price of $93.85 per barrel, this 
being the closing price as at 31 December 2007, the date of the 
r eserve r eport, the n et present value at a 10% discount 
(npv 10 ) of the proved reserves was $214.0 million (2006: 
$128.0 million). t he npv 10 of the 2p reserves totalled $641.2 
million (2006: $427.0 million) and the npv 10 of the 3p reserves 
totalled $2.5 billion (2006: $1.7 billion).
o f the 4.2 million boe reduction in the 2 p reserves in 2007 
against 2006, 0.4 million boe was attributable to the production 
in 2007, 2.9 million boe of the reduction, almost 70%, was a 
consequence of forecasted substantially higher oil prices 
accelerating the Company's cost recovery and therefore allowing 
ecopetrol S.A. (ecopetrol ), the state oil company and the 
partner in the bolivar and bocachico contracts, to back-in to these 
two Colombian contracts at earlier dates in the future. in addition, 
a revised development approach at the bolivar contract resulted 
in lower future development costs further accelerating ecopetrol's 
back-in. Anticipated accelerated ecopetrol back-in also accounted 
for 12.5 million boe , approximately 74%, of the 16.8 million boe 
reduction in the 3p reserves.
Gross recoverable 3p reserves in 2007 totalled 106.0 million 
boe . t his was a 2% increase against 2006 (2006: 103.7 million 
boe ) and therefore indicated that engineering remained almost 
entirely unchanged since the 2006 r eserve r eport.
t herefore, while substantially improved oil prices in 2007 have 
decreased the Company's contractual share of future oil 
production, they have also increased the Company's 2p property 
value by over 50% against 2006.

Overview of contracts and activities
t he Company currently holds five contracts in Colombia, one 
contract in peru and one contract in panama. t he Company is 
currently fully compliant with the terms of each of these 
contracts.
During 2007, the Company undertook drilling at the Colombian 
l una l lena contract. t he first well, l una l lena 1, tested fresh 
formation water with small traces of hydrocarbons. While the 
second well, l una l lena 2, proved the existence of a productive 
horizon and possibly significant reserves, an independent 
technical study indicated that a major portion of these reserves 
were located underneath or in close proximity to the meta r iver 
meaning a very capital intensive work programme would be 
needed to potentially realise these reserves and that commercial 
development would be very high risk. Although the Company 
exceeded the capital investment obligations for the initial phase 
of the contract, the complications resulting from the location of 
the reserves and potential environmental restrictions, the 
unexpected additional capital requirement and very restrictive 
rainy season resulted in the Company not being able to meet all 
of the specific work commitments within the time period 
provided for under the contract. As a result, as at 31 march 2008 
the Company no longer held the contract. t he l una l lena 
contract, however, accounted for no reserves within the 2007 
r eserve r eport and only 341,000 boe of 3 p reserves in the 
2006 r eserve r eport.
During 2007, the Colombian l os Sauces contract was also 
terminated and relinquished to the n ational Hydrocarbons 
Agency of the r epublic of Colombia (An H ) as the Company 
was unable to secure a rig due to industry-wide equipment 
availability constraints and therefore unable to complete its work 
obligations under the contract. t he l os Sauces contract 
accounted for none of the Company's reserves in either the 
2006 or 2007 r eserve r eports.

Drilling equipment for the boral 1 well  
within the r io verde contract in Colombia Annu Al report 2007 Glob Al ener Gy Development pl C 07  vice Chairman and managing Director's review
in relation to the peruvian block 95 contract, the Company is 
awaiting the environmental permit required to undertake drilling. 
o nce this is obtained, the Company will proceed to finalise the 
details of the drilling programme with the first obligation well 
contractually required by late 2009. 
t he Company signed the panamanian Garachine contract during 
June 2007, the first hydrocarbons contract the panamanian 
government had signed since 1990. t he Company is on 
schedule with the currently required geological and geophysical 
work obligations and anticipates completion of all phase 1 
requirements on or before n ovember 2008.
Since the end of 2007, the Company has experienced some field 
underperformance at some of its older fields, predominately at 
the palo blanco field within the Colombian Alcaravan contract. 
t he field underperformance is partially due to an increasing 
percentage of well downtime due to surface mechanical 
conditions and also delays caused by the lack of rigs to repair 
down hole problems. t his resulted in average net production for 
the first quarter of 2008 of 982 barrels of oil per day (bopd ) 
versus 1,126 bopd for 2007. t he Company is currently addressing 
the palo blanco field power generation facilities issues which 
have been the major source of mechanical downtime. in may 
2008, production has been restored to approximately 1,000 
bopd net to the Company.
t he management believes that the current two-well drilling 
programme at the Colombian r io verde contract has the 
potential to significantly enhance current production levels. t he 
r io verde contract contains the t ilodiran field containing the 
t ilodiran 2 well which is currently producing 500 net bopd and 
has outperformed original decline rate projections resulting in 
r yder Scott assigning a 30% increase in the t ilodiran field proved 
reserves for 2007. t he second of the two wells to be drilled 
back-to-back is the t ilodiran 3 well, a direct offset to the t ilodiran 
2 well and is classified by r yder Scott as a proved, undeveloped 
location. t he first well, the exploratory boral 1 well, has now 
been drilled vertically to a total depth of 12,340 feet, production 
casing has been set and initial testing is underway to evaluate the 
Gacheta and ubaque formations, with both these formations 
present in the t ilodiran field. t he boral 1 well is structurally updip 
from the r io verde 1 well which was drilled several years ago by 
a previous operator. r yder Scott has assigned a total of eight 
possible drilling locations to develop the boral field based upon 
seismic and the r io verde 1 well log information.
