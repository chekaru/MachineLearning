Chairman's statement
The overall performance for the year benefited from
a much improved second half in the UK, alongside
ongoing strong growth in our international
business.

Alpha Airports Group Plc
Annual Report 2005/06
The events of the past two months
have overshadowed what was
otherwise a period of ongoing
progress for the Group.
Suspension
The issues that gave rise to the
suspension of the Company's shares
are set out fully in the Special
Committee's Report on page 6, but in
summary they did not affect the results
for the year in terms of profit or cash
and there is no suggestion that they
gave rise to any indirect advantage
either financial or otherwise for any
member of staff or the Board.
However, they fall short of the levels of
corporate governance that a public
company should adhere to and the
Board is determined to deal properly
with that issue following the
resignation of both the Chief Executive,
Kevin Abbott, and the Finance Director,
Heather McRae, on 16 May.
Following these resignations, we were
fortunate to recruit Peter Williams as
Chief Executive and Tim Redburn as
interim Finance Director . Both Peter
and Tim are highly rated and seasoned
executives who have already made
excellent progress in restoring
confidence with all of our stakeholders
including shareholders, customers,
suppliers and employees as well as
with all of our external advisers. With
the search for a permanent Finance
Director underway, the Board is
confident that the management of the
Group is in safe hands.
Following the issue of the Report of the
Special Committee and the issue by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC)
of an unqualified Audit Report on the
Group, I consider that it is now
appropriate for me to step down from
the Board to enable a new Chairman to
be appointed who can provide long-
term support for both Peter Williams
and the Company. The search for my
successor has commenced and Peter
Williams will act as Chairman of the
Board until an appointment is made.
Preliminary results reconfirmed
I am pleased to report that after a
thorough review by the Company and
its advisers and completion of the audit
by PwC, we have been able to
reconfirm the results of the Group for
the year ended 31 January 2006, as
released on 30 March, with no
adjustment. These results are now
audited.
Dividend
The Board continues to recommend a
final dividend of 3.2p (2004/05: 3.0p),
giving a full year dividend per share of
4.2p (2004/05: 4.0p). Following
approval at the AGM, the dividend
would be payable on 6 October 2006 to
shareholders on the register as at
8 September 2006.
Review of the year
The year under review was a period of
significant developments across the
airline and airport industries. The
growth of low-cost carriers despite the
sharp rise in oil prices, privatisation of
airport assets around the world, bid
activity both in the UK and
internationally for airport operators,
and industrial relations strife were all
headline news and are factors
influencing our thinking on the future
shape of the business.
Against a backdrop of increasing
competitive pressures in the UK, and
following a disappointing first half
profit, the management team focused
on building a stronger performance in
our core UK market through a
programme of continued innovation.
In the latter part of the year, a
programme of cost reduction was
introduced, the benefits of which are
now being seen in an improving margin
performance.

It is, therefore, particularly pleasing to
report that the overall performance for
the year benefited from a much
improved second half in the UK,
alongside ongoing strong growth in
our international business. We are
also particularly encouraged by our
international business which
continues to grow from strength to
strength. 
Alpha is an internationally recognised
aviation support company. At a recent
worldwide industry event, Alpha was
acclaimed the 2006 Airport Travel
Retailer of the Year  as voted for by our
global suppliers. In our airline services
business, we remain the only top three
global player to generate both sales
growth and ongoing profitability over
the past five years. 
Across our business, the Group
continues to generate high
performances for our airline and
airport customer partners, and we
continue to gain new customer
partners. Today, Alpha's 6,900 staff
service over 100 airlines worldwide
and operate from over 200 outlets at 83
airports in 15 countries.
Whilst truly a global business, Alpha's
UK and Ireland operations remain the
bedrock of the business, accounting
for some 82% of Group revenues. In a
highly competitive environment, we
are pleased with the rate of top line
growth but this has not been reflected
in our bottom line performance. In the
year under review, just 41% of
operating profit (before exceptional
items and impairment charges and
after including the share of post tax
profits of associate and joint venture)
came from the UK and Ireland
markets. This represents an operating
profit return on sales of only 2%. 
Conversely, our international
business, representing only 18% of the
Group's sales, and 59% of the Group's
operating profit, generated an
operating profit return on sales of 12%. 
With competition set to intensify as
European competitors seek to expand
their presence in the UK and Ireland,
improving our domestic return on
sales is an absolute priority if we are to
retain our market leading positions in
the UK and Ireland.
Since the year end, progress has been
made on restructuring the Group into
two distinct business units focusing on
our UK and international businesses.
Within the UK, the business has been
further restructured into two divisions,
Alpha Airline Services and Alpha
Airport Services. 
Whilst we will continue to explore
further international development
opportunities, it is clear that
management's focus must remain on
improving the profitability of our
business in the UK.
Results
This is the first set of full year results
that the Group is reporting under
International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS). With the balance of
earnings weighted towards the second
half, underlying pre-tax profit (before
exceptional items and impairment
charges and after including the post
tax results of joint venture and
associate) increased 6.3% to  18.5m,
on sales 13% ahead of last year at
 551m. With significantly lower net
exceptional items compared to the
previous year, profit before tax
increased 40% to  18.4m.
In the UK and Ireland, operating profit
(before exceptional items and
impairment charges and after
including the post tax results of joint
venture and associate) declined 33%,
from  13.1m to  8.8m, despite 9%
ongoing sales growth. Conversely, our
international business generated a
significant 98% increase in operating
profit from  6.3m to  12.5m on an
excellent 34% sales growth partly
driven by acquisitions.
This was a year of significant
investment for the Group:
   21m in capital expenditure,
including our major IT and business
transformation project (IRIS); and
   4m in acquisitions in Romania and
Bulgaria.
The net debt as at the year end was
 37m but debt has risen in subsequent
5

months due to seasonal variances and
further investment. During the year
we entered into a new  100m five year
multi-currency revolving banking
facility which gives us headroom to
leverage further expansion of the
business.
Pensions
As with many employers, we have had
to review our pension provision going
forward. We have moved to a  career
average' basis, against the previous
 final salary' provision, so as to
maintain an excellent ongoing pension
benefit, but at a cost which is
affordable to both the employee and
the employer . With an employee
contribution level of 8% of salary
already in place, we knew that our
employees were unwilling to pay even
more to protect their previous  final
salary' benefit.
Outlook
The costs associated with the share
suspension and the investigation,
together with the other consequential
costs, will give rise to an exceptional
item in the half year ending 31 July
2006, which is expected to be in the
region of  3m.
Operating profit for the first four
months of the year is ahead of the
comparable period with improved
performances overseas and in UK
Airline Services. With an ongoing
commitment to innovation, tighter
operational focus and strong finances
in place, the Board believes the
current year should see further
progress. However the balance of the
year will be affected by the absence of
the contribution from the ThomsonFly
contract which ended in April 2006.
The aviation services market remains
highly competitive but we are
confident that the new senior
management team has made a good
start by restoring confidence with all
our stakeholders and will bring fresh
impetus to drive Alpha forward.
