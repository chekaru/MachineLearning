Director's Responsibilities in the

give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the group, and of the profit
or loss of the group for that year.
In preparing these accounts the directors are required to:
  select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;
  make reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates;
  state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, and give details
of any departures;
  prepare the accounts on a going concern basis unless in our view the group will be unable
to continue in business;
The directors are also responsible for:
  keeping proper accounting records;
  safeguarding the group's assets;
  taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud.
The directors are responsible for ensuring that the directors' report and other
information included in the annual report is prepared in accordance with Company Law in the
United Kingdom.

We have audited the financial statements on pages 13 to 38 of Honeycombe Leisure plc for the period ended 27 April 2003.
These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and the accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state
to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or
for the opinions we have formed.
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
The directors' responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards are set out in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United
Kingdom Auditing Standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors' Report is not consistent
with the financial statements, if the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors' remuneration and
transactions with the company is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial
statements. This other information comprises the Highlights, the Directors' Report and the Chairman's Statement. We
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An
audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It
also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the financial
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company's circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the affairs of the company and the group as at
27 April 2003 and of the group's profit for the period then ended, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.
