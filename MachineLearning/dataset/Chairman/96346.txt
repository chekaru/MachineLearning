Introduction
The Group's move into profitability is
ahead of original market expectations of 
a loss and reflects the very strong
progress we have made on many fronts
this year, especially in signing major new
ATM network owners.
There were two primary drivers of the
significant revenue growth we achieved 
in the year; firstly, improving advertising
sales from third party advertisers using
our estate of ATM screens and, secondly,
two major contract wins, with Barclays
and YourCash Limited, who bought
licences to use our unique marketing
software solution for their ATM estates.
These latest major contract wins confirm
the dominance of our solution in the UK
ATM market, where it is deployed across
six major ATM networks. The win with
YourCash Limited, Europe's largest
independent provider of ATMs, also
demonstrates the appeal of our offering 
in overseas markets, where we are seeing
increasing interest. 
The year was also notable for the launch
of  joono', the next generation of our
marketing software solution, which took
place in June 2011. The launch of joono 
is an important development in the
evolution of our offering to ATM network
owners. The functionality and range of
joono is broader and more advanced than
its predecessor while preserving all the
benefits. It also opens up the delivery 
of additional digital communications
channels to customers, including mobile
phones and plasma screens. At the same
time, joono enables ATM network owners
to manage their digital marketing
communications simply, on a single
platform. In July 2011, Cardtronics, Inc.,
the US-based ATM operator which is the
world's largest non-bank owner of ATMs,
reached an agreement with us to buy a
global licence to incorporate joono into 
its own ATM offering. This is our second
major agreement with Cardtronics and
follows their adoption of our solution
across part of its ATM estate last year. 
We have started the new financial year to
30 September 2012 in very good shape.
Our total licensed ATM estate (including
machines where ATM owners are using
our solution to run only their own
marketing initiatives) is significantly 
larger than at the same point last year,
standing at 21,500 ATMs up from 17,000.
Geographically, we are making headway
and now have a presence in the
Netherlands through our agreement with
YourCash in addition to the US and South
America. In addition, we recently secured
our first contract in Canada, with a large
Bank, taking us into another important
new territory. This all gives us a solid
platform from which to move forward 
and with a strong balance sheet and 
the next generation of our marketing
solution launched, we believe that growth
prospects remain very encouraging. 
Results 
T otal revenue for the year ended 30
September 2011 was  3.5 million,
representing a 62% increase from  2.17
million in 2010, helped by revenue growth
across all areas. Gross profit increased 
to  1,377,000 (2010:  435,000). 
We continued to focus on tight cost
controls in the year and, as a result,
administrative costs were 8% lower 
than last year at  1,300,000 (2010:
 1,408,000). The Group moved into
profitability as a consequence of higher
revenues and reduced administrative
costs, generating an operating profit of
 101,000 (2010: operating loss  966,000).
The maiden profit before tax was
 105,000 (2010: loss before tax
 962,000). It should be noted that this
includes  74,000 relating to capitalisation
of research and development costs, in
compliance with IAS 38. Further
information on this is provided in note 8.
After R&D tax credits of  46,000 (2010:
 240,000), the profit after tax was
 151,000 (2010: loss after tax  723,000).
The basic profit per share was 1.1p 
(2010: loss per share 5.1p). 
The net cash inflow from operating
activities was  161,000 (2010: outflow
 1,061,000), with other taxation receipts
and investing and financing inflows of
 34,000 (2010: inflows  127,000) resulting
in a cash inflow of  195,000 in the year
(2010: outflow  934,000). 
Outstanding borrowings of  12,500 at 
30 September 2010 (a bank loan) were
cleared during the year. Outstanding
borrowings of  13,000 at 30 September
2011 represent finance leases on the
purchase of computer equipment. The
Group's net cash and cash equivalents
position at the year-end stood at
 941,000, an increase of 26% against 
the same point last year (2010:  747,000). 
Dividend
As previously indicated, the Directors
intend to devote the Company's cash
resources to growing its operations.
However, we will reconsider the
Company's dividend policy as and 
when the Company is in a position to 
pay a dividend.
Business Progress
We have made excellent progress during
the year, both in extending i-design's
estate of ATMs licensed to use our
marketing software solution and in
building sales from third party advertising. 
We have expanded the number of ATMs
running our unique marketing software,
both in the UK and overseas, where we
Chairman's Statement
I am delighted to announce that i-design generated a
maiden profit before taxation of  105k for the year
ended 30 September 2011 on revenues which
increased by 62% year on year to  3.52m.  5
are seeing increasing interest. In October
2010, the Group signed a multi-year
contract with YourCash, the largest
independent provider of ATM solutions 
in Europe, with an estate totalling 
6,000 ATMs in the UK and 600 in the
Netherlands. Our agreement with
YourCash covers part of its estate,
approximately 500 of its free to use 
ATMs. Of these, 300 are in the UK and 
the remaining 200 are located in the
Netherlands, taking us into a new territory. 
Following the YourCash agreement, in
May 2011 we signed Barclays Bank 
as a major new customer. Our licence
agreement with Barclays covers its entire
UK estate of approximately 4,000 ATMs
and self-service kiosks. Barclays is now
the sixth major ATM operator in the UK 
to adopt our solution, which can be used
both for in-house marketing campaigns
and for third party advertising. 
Our major contract with Barclays has
taken the total number of ATMs licensed
to use i-design's software to over 21,500.
This represents a doubling over the
number at September 2007. Of these
21,500 ATMs, approximately 8,500 are
available for third party advertising
compared to 1,000 at September 2007.
The increase in the number of ATMs
available for third party advertising should
help to drive our advertising sales. 
With ATMs supplying 70% of all cash to
individuals in the UK and more than 60%
of the UK population regularly using cash
machines, ATMs continue to represent a
highly attractive channel for both banks
and third party advertisers to reach
consumers. The channel is especially
attractive since it enables advertisers 
to communicate with consumers in a
highly engaged, one-to-one manner, 
both through screens and through cash
receipts. We estimate that each customer
engagement provides over 40 seconds of
one-to-one interaction and we are able 
to track engagements accurately through
our software, making i-design the only
directly measurable digital outdoor 
media globally. 
i-design now benefits from having the
largest UK digital screen network, with
third party advertising available on c.6,100
ATMs in the UK. Our licensed overseas
third party advertising estate currently
stands at 2,400 ATMs, with 2,200 ATMs
available for third party advertising in the
US and 200 in the Netherlands. 
Our income from third party advertising
rose by 66% over the year and we continue
to add new customers, including Colgate,
McDonalds, Screwfix and Unilever. 
In June 2011, we launched joono, our next
generation marketing solution. The new
solution has significant new features
compared with our original ATM marketing
software. In particular, it introduces new
interactive features such as personalised
ATM marketing. joono will also enable
ATM network owners to communicate with
their customers through additional digital
channels, including mobile phones and
plasma screens, as well as ATMs and self-
service devices. The management of all
digital marketing communications can
also be handled centrally on the joono
platform. Cardtronics subsequent
decision in July to agree a licence with 
us to incorporate joono into its own ATM
offering on a global basis was strong
validation of our new software.
Team Effort 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to
thank all of our staff for their hard work
and commitment during the year. We are
also grateful for the continued support of
our customers and shareholders.
Prospects
While the current economic backdrop
creates uncertainties, we believe that
growth prospects for the Group are
attractive. The business has made
significant strides in the last two years 
and the launch of our new generation
product this summer is helping to
reinforce our position as the leading
operator in digital marketing solutions 
for ATM owners. Our recently announced
major new contract with a large bank in
Canada underlines our confidence in 
our offering and its growth potential.
i-design is well-placed financially and
operationally to continue its expansion
and we will provide a further update on
trading in January at our Annual General
Meeting.
