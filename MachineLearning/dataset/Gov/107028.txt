experience, with the intention that no individual or small 
group of individuals should be able to dominate decision 
making. The Board has not appointed a Senior Independent 
Director. However, any of the Non-Executive Directors 
are available on request as a conduit of communication to 
the Board in the event that the Chairman and/or the Chief 
Executive Officer are not appropriate conduits for shareholder 
concerns and issues.

committees
The Board operates through clearly identified Board 
committees to which it delegates certain powers. These are 
the Remuneration Committee, the Audit Committee, the 
Nominations Committee and the Executive Committee. 
They are properly authorised under the constitution of the 
Company to take decisions and act on behalf of the Board 
within the guidelines and delegations laid down by the 
Board. The Board is kept fully informed of the work of these 
committees and each committee has access and support from 
the Company Secretary.  
Any issues requiring resolution are referred to the full  
Board. A summary of the operations of these Committees  
is set out below. 
The Remuneration Committee's role is to determine and 
recommend to the Board the terms and conditions of service, 
the remuneration and grant of options to Executive Directors 
under the EMI scheme adopted by the Company. 
The Audit Committee's primary responsibilities are to 
monitor the quality of internal control, ensure that the 
financial performance of the Company is properly measured 
and reported on, and to review reports from the Company's 
auditor relating to its accounting and internal controls, in all 
cases having due regard to the interests of the shareholders.
The Nominations Committee leads the process for Board 
appointments. It vets and presents to the Board potential 
new Directors, particularly Non-Executives. All new 
appointees undergo a rigorous nomination process before  
the Board agrees on their appointment.
The Executive Committee comprises Prof. Roger Putnam 
as Chairman, Dr Graham Cooley (CEO) and Dr Simon 
Bourne (CTO). The Committee regularly meets to consider 
business development, management issues and the financial 
performance of the Company.

and the terms of appointment of each of the Non-Executive 
Directors can be obtained by contacting the Company 
Secretary at the Company's head office. 
In addition, the Board receives reports and recommendations 
from time to time on matters that it considers significant to

Boar D Performa Nce a PPraisal
With the full support of the Board, the Chairman leads an evaluation of the performance of the Board and its Committees  
on a yearly basis. The last review concluded that the Board and its Committee are currently effective and each Director 
continues to demonstrate commitment to their role. 
re -electioN of Directors
New Directors are subject to election at the first Annual General Meeting of the Company following their appointment. In addition,  
all Directors who have been in office for three years or more since their election or last re-election are required to submit 
themselves for re-election at the Annual General Meeting of the Company. At each Annual General Meeting of the Company all 
those Non-Executive Directors who have been in office for nine years or more since the date on which they were originally elected 
as a Non-Executive Director of the Company are required to retire from office, but may stand for re-appointment. 
Boar D iNDe Pe NDe Nce 
The Board recognises that Peter Hargreave's shareholding is a factor which, under the UK Corporate Governance Code, may 
appear to impair his independence. However, the Board considers all the Non-Executive Directors to be independent in character 
and judgement. The Non-Executive Directors have provided excellent independent advice and challenge throughout the year.  
In concluding that all its Non-Executive Directors are independent, the Company considered, inter-alia, the fact that all of the  
Non-Executive Directors are Directors of other corporations and are not reliant on any shares or share options they hold in,  
or income they receive from, ITM Power plc.

The Board is responsible for the Group's system of internal control. Such a system 
can only be designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. Whilst it would not be practical for the Group, 
given its size, to maintain a dedicated Internal Audit function these internal controls are 
reviewed periodically to check that they are operating as planned. The Group also has 
in place processes to deal with the identification, assessment and management of major 
business risks and reviews these processes as required.
relatio Ns with sharehol Ders
The Company values the views of shareholders and recognises their interests  
in the Group's strategy and performance.
Overall responsibility for ensuring that there is effective communication with 
investors and that the Board understands the views of major shareholders rests  
with the Chief Executive Officer, who makes himself available to meet shareholders 
for this purpose. Press coverage packs and analyst notes are made available to 
the Board at each regular Board meeting. The Chief Executive Officer is often 
accompanied at investor presentations by either the Chairman or the Chief Financial 
Officer. Shareholder communication is mainly co-ordinated by the Company's 
Corporate Communications Consultants, Tavistock Communications Limited.  
ITM Power is committed to maintaining a good dialogue with shareholders through 
proactively organising meetings and presentations with fund managers, retail brokers 
and analysts, as well as responding to a wide range of enquiries. The Company also 
recognises the importance of communicating appropriately any significant company 
developments. This is done via the Stock Exchange Regulatory News Service, which 
can be accessed through the Company's new website. 
The Company reports to shareholders twice a year. The reports and accounts 
are available on the Company's website: www.itm-power.com. All shareholders 
are encouraged to attend the Company's Annual General Meeting, at which the 
Chairman gives an account of the progress of the business over the year and provides 
the opportunity for shareholders to ask questions. The Board attends the meeting 
and is available to answer questions from present shareholders.
In all communications and events, care is taken to ensure that no price sensitive 
information is released and that any price-sensitive information is released to all 
shareholders at the same time, in accordance with AIM Rules.
au Ditor iNDe Pe NDe Nce 
The Group and Company seek to ensure the independence of its Auditor by limiting 
the non-audit work it performs. The Group and Company uses a range of advisors  
to give specialist advice in relevant areas.
