STRATEGIC REPORT

Principal risks and uncertainties
As with all businesses, we are affected by a number of risks and uncertainties, of which some are beyond our control. The table below shows the principal risks 
and uncertainties which could have a material adverse effect on the Group and have been identified through the risk management framework on page 37 .
This is not an exhaustive list and there may be risks and uncertainties of which currently we are unaware, or which are believed to be immaterial, which 
could have an adverse effect on the business.
In the previous year we also included risks in relation to business continuity, increasing compliance requirements from customers and competition in 
the Hull and East Yorkshire area. We are still closely managing these risks, but these are not currently considered to be among the key risks facing the 
business and therefore these have not been reported on specifically below.

Risks continuing from last year
Security and resilience of our 
networks and IT systems
Our networks and IT systems are key to all that we do and are crucial 
in delivering service to our customers. The risk in the year has 
increased due to an increase in external security threats, including 
larger volume of attacks intended to create a denial of service.
As the risk has increased, so has our work to mitigate the risk. We 
have implemented increased security and we continue to closely 
monitor any attempted attacks and take actions where necessary to 
ensure we have robust security in place. We have held the ISO 27001 
Information Security Management standard since 2007 and also 
comply with other security standards as required by our customers.
This links directly to our processes and systems, as well as being key 
to our customer pillar as ensuring security of our networks and IT 
systems is a clear customer need.
Accuracy, security and 
confidentiality of customer data
Security of customer data, whether it belongs to a business or 
an individual, is of paramount importance to our customers and 
therefore to us. The potential risk to data security has increased 
in the year as a result of the increased volume of external attacks 
seen across all industries. 
We have rolled out mandatory information security training and 
data protection training to all our people and have a clear Data 
Governance policy in place, which contains specific handling 
guidelines for different types of data. Any incidents, however minor, 
are investigated and control improvements implemented where 
necessary to ensure that we keep our customer data secure at 
all times.
This has a direct impact on our customers and also links to 
our processes and systems pillar as our processes and systems play 
a pivotal role in keeping our data accurate, secure and confidential.
Customer service and delivery
Delivering exceptional service to our customers is one of our key 
strategic aims and therefore the risk of failing to do this is a key risk 
for us to mitigate.
We have continued to invest in our people and our systems to 
ensure that we have the right people in the right roles and that they 
have the right tools to provide an exceptional service. We also work 
closely with our partners to ensure that they are aligned with us in 
delivering the best service possible.
This links to all aspects of our Group strategy and is key to the 
whole of our business.
Recruitment and retention 
of the right people
Recruiting and retaining the right people is crucial for the success of 
the Group in meeting our objectives. This applies not only to being 
able to recruit people who embody our values, but also to recruiting 
people with specific technical skills where needed, some of which 
may be in short supply. It also involves developing the skills in-house 
and creating internal mobility around deploying those skills.
Our People Strategy is focused on creating a workplace which not 
only attracts top talent but also retains those people that are key to 
delivering on our objectives. During the year we have focused on 
communicating total reward packages to our people to ensure that 
everyone understands their total reward. We have also been creating 
a competency framework across the Group, which will enable us to 
create more career opportunities for individuals internally and to 
respond to our customers with greater agility.
Recruiting and retaining the right people is part of the people pillar 
of our Group strategy, whilst also having an impact on our customers 
and the level of service that they receive.
Reliance on key third party 
partners and suppliers
Our business model means that we are reliant on several key partners 
to deliver service to our customers and to provide the equipment that 
we need to deliver the right solutions; such as BT, Comms-Care, 
ForgeRock, Cisco, Avaya, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and IBM.
We have dedicated teams to work alongside our key partners and we 
monitor all of our partnerships closely so that any potential issues are 
identified and resolved before becoming significant. We have also 
multiple partners in key risk areas to mitigate the risk in the event 
of failure of one partner.
This links directly to the partners pillar of our Group strategy 
and also impacts upon our customers. KCOM Group PLC
