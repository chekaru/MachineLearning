10 Intangible assets (continued)
The carrying value of goodwill, calculated on a value in use basis, is allocated to cash generating units as follows:
 2008 2007
  000  000
Pinnacle Voice and Data Limited (now incorporated in Maintel Voice and Data Limited) 232  294
District Holdings Limited (now incorporated in
Maintel Europe Limited and Maintel Voice and Data Limited) 145 203
 377 497
Goodwill of  227,000 arising on the acquisition of Pinnacle Voice and Data Limited (since renamed Maintel Network Solutions 
Limited) in December 2005 was capitalised at 31 December 2005, as was the related deferred payment of  147,000 in 2006, 
the aggregate being subject to an annual impairment review which has resulted in an impairment charge of  18,000 in 2007 
and  62,000 in 2008, due to the termination of certain contracts acquired.  
Goodwill of  290,000 arose on the acquisition of District Holdings Limited in June 2006. This is assessed for impairment at 
each balance sheet date based on value in use calculations, being the projected future discounted cash flows arising from the 
acquisition, compared with the carrying value of the goodwill. The impairment of the goodwill has been  58,000 in 2007 and 
 58,000 in 2008. 
The acquisition of District customer relationships was valued at  965,000. These relationships are estimated to have a useful 
life of 5 years and are therefore amortised over that period and subject to annual impairment review. The 2007 amortisation 
charge is therefore  193,000 and the 2008 charge  193,000.
The Group acquired a base of customer relationships from Callmaster Limited on 1 August 2007, for a consideration, 
including costs, of  448,000. These relationships are estimated to have a useful life of five (maintenance contracts) or seven 
(network services contracts) years and are therefore amortised over those periods and subject to annual impairment review. 
The 2007 amortisation charge is  29,000 and the 2008 charge  70,000.
For the purposes of the impairment review of goodwill, the net present value of the projected future cash flows of the 
cash generating unit are compared with the carrying value. Projected operating margins for this purpose are based on 
current trends, and a discount rate of 15.6% is applied to the resultant projected cash flows; the discount rate is based on 
conventional capital asset pricing model inputs.
