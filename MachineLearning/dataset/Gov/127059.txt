Directors' Report (continued)
Directors' responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law  
and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the directors have elected to 
prepare the financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS and applicable law). The 
financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of 
the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the directors are required to:
l select suitable accounting policies and then apply them  
 consistently except for new accounting policies as included in  
 note 2;
l make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
l state whether applicable IFRS have been followed, subject to  
 any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial  
 statements; and
l prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis  
 unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will  
 continue in business. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure the 
financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.  
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the company 
and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

The Company is listed on AIM. Although the AIM Rules for 
Companies do not require compliance with the Financial Reporting 
Council's Combined Code on Corporate Governance the Code ,  
the Board fully supports and has applied the principles 
recommended by the 2006 version of the Code and is committed 
to ensuring that high standards of corporate governance are 
maintained by the Group.
The Board considers that during the financial year it has made 
progress in establishing good corporate governance practice 
principles.
The Company is not fully compliant with provisions of Section 1 of 
the Code but continues to seek compliance wherever practical, given 
both the size of the Company and the resources available.
Board Structure
During the financial year, the Board comprised three non-executive 
directors, one of which was the Chairman, and three executive 
directors. 
In accordance with the Code, the roles of the Chairman, Omer 
Karim, and the Chief Executive Officer, Philip Stimpson, are separated 
and clearly defined and have been approved by the Board. In 
addition to chairing the Board, the Chairman is part of the Audit 
Committee and the Salaries and Remuneration Committee which 
considers matters including succession planning, the process of 
Board appointments and evaluating the individual performance 
of each director. The Chairman is also responsible for ensuring 
that the members of the Board receive accurate, timely and clear 
information to enable the directors to make sound decisions and 
fulfil their statutory and fiduciary duties. The Chief Executive Officer 
is responsible for the overall management of the Group's business, 
the development of the Group's strategic direction, implementation 
and delivery of the annual business plan and the effective leadership, 
coordination and performance of the executive team. The Chief 
Executive Officer also ensures that the Group's strategies, plans and 
major developments are effectively communicated to shareholders 
and he maintains strong relationships with key external stakeholders 
in order to understand any concerns they may have regarding the 
Company and communicates these back to the Board.
The non-executive directors possess a wide range of skills and 
experience and the Board considers that each of the non-executive 
directors who served throughout the financial year was independent 
within the meaning of the Code.  
All directors have access to the advice and services of the  
Company Secretary and also to independent professional advice 
where required.  
During the financial year the Chairman, Omer Karim, continued 
his roles as a consultant urological surgeon in the NHS and private 
sector. His commitments to these roles are not considered to be such 
that he is not able to devote sufficient time to his Chairmanship of 
the Company.  
Also during the year, the Finance Director, Christian Rollins resigned 
to take up a position outside the medical device industry. Dr Marcus 
Harrison joined the Board as Chief Scientific Officer and Colm 
Croskery stepped into the Finance Director role.
The Board has established a formal policy of delegated authorities 
setting out matters which require its express approval and the 
authorities delegated to the executive directors.  The Board receives 
an information pack in advance of each meeting containing 
thorough reports from the executive directors, management 
accounts and any other material deemed necessary for the Board to 
discharge its duties.  The Board has responsibility for formulating, 
reviewing and approving the Group's strategy, budgets, major items 
of capital expenditure, corporate transactions, risk management 
policies, treasury policies, succession planning, appointments to the 
Board and material investments and disposals.
The Board recognises that an essential part of its responsibilities 
is the effective safeguarding of assets, the proper recognition of 
liabilities and the accurate reporting of results.  The Group has a 
comprehensive system for regular reporting to the Board including 
an annual budgeting system with budgets approved by the Board.  
The financial reporting system compares actual results against 
budget and prior year and reconsiders its financial forecasts for the 
balance of the prevailing year on a regular basis.
