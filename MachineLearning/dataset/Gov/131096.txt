 Explanation for non-compliance with 
parts of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the  Code')
The reasons for non-compliance with  
certain parts of the Code are set out in the 
Corporate governance statement on page 19. 
Specifically, the Audit Committee did not 
comply with the relevant parts of the Code  
set out below, for the periods noted:
Provision C.3.1 (constitution of the  
Audit Committee)
There were not at least three independent  
Non-Executive Directors on the Committee 
between 11 February 2011 and year end;
The Company Chairman was a member of  
the Committee between 11 February 2011 
and year end;
The Company Chairman was Committee 
Chairman between 11 February 2011 and  
13 July 2011;
The Committee included two members  
who were not considered independent 
between 19 August 2011 and year end; and
The current Committee Chairman  
(appointed 19 August 2011) is not considered 
independent in accordance with the Code.
The Company complied with the remaining 
Code provisions which impact the Audit 
Committee throughout the year ended  
24 September 2011.
The Board believes that other than the 
breaches above relating to composition 
compliance arising from lack of quoracy, it  
has discharged its responsibilities in line with 
the Code, in that normal Audit Committee 
functions were dealt with by the full Board.
The Committee recognises the 
recommendations within the FRC Guidance 
on Audit Committees concerning the 
Chairman of the Company not being a 
member of the Audit Committee, but wishes 
to retain the knowledge, experience and 
judgement of the Chairman of the Board,  
Bob Ivell, pending the appointment of 
additional Non-Executive Directors to  
the Committee.
A copy of the Committee's terms of reference 
is publicly available within the Investor section 
of the Company's website.
Role of the Audit Committee
The Committee's principal responsibilities  
are to:
   review the Company's public statements  
on internal control, risk management and 
corporate governance compliance prior  
to their consideration by the Board;
   review the Company's processes for 
detecting fraud, misconduct and control 
weaknesses and to consider the Company's 
response to any such occurrence;
   review management's evaluation of  
any change in internal controls over  
financial reporting;
   review with management and the external 
auditor any financial statements required 
under UK legislation before submission to 
the Board;
   establish, review and maintain the role and 
effectiveness of the Internal Audit function, 
known as Group Assurance, whose objective 
is to provide independent assurance over 
the Group's significant processes and 
controls, including those in respect of the 
Group's key risks;
   assume direct responsibility for the 
appointment, compensation, resignation, 
dismissal and the overseeing of the external 
auditor, including review of the external

   pre-approve non-audit work to be carried 
out by the external auditor and the fees  
to be paid for that work together with the 
monitoring of the external auditor's 
independence;
   oversee the process for dealing with 
complaints received by the Group regarding 
accounting, internal accounting controls or 
auditing matters and the confidential, 
anonymous submission by employees  
of concerns regarding questionable 
accounting or auditing matters; and
   adopt and oversee a specific Code of  
Ethics for all corporate employees which  
is consistent with the Company's overall 
statement of business ethics.

Audit Committee process
The Committee discharges its responsibilities, 
as defined in its terms of reference, through  
a series of Audit Committee meetings 
throughout the year at which detailed reports 
are presented for review. The Committee 
commissions reports from external advisers, 
the Director of Group Assurance, or Company 
management, either after consideration of the 
Company's major risks or in response to 
developing issues. The Committee normally 
meets privately with the external auditor and 
the Director of Group Assurance at least four 
times a year and liaises with Company 
management in considering areas for review.
During the year, the Committee, or the  
Board where the Committee was not fully 
constituted, considered the following matters:
   interim and full year financial results;
   the scope and cost of the external audit;
   non-audit work carried out by the external 
auditor and trends in the non-audit fees in 
accordance with the Committee's policy to 
ensure the safeguard of audit independence;
   the arrangements in respect of Group 
Assurance including its resourcing and 
external support and the scope of the  
annual internal audit plan;
   the external auditor's interim and full  
year reports;
   periodic internal control and assurance 
reports from Group Assurance;
   the removal of the previous external auditor 
and appointment of the current external 
auditor, in respect of which the Committee's 
recommendation was based on the results  
of a formal tender process;
   reports on allegations made via the Group's 
whistleblowing procedures and the 
effectiveness of these procedures;
   management representations granted to  
the external auditor and the Company's 
procedures to ensure all relevant audit 
information has been disclosed;
   major changes in the Group's internal 
controls;
   the co-ordination of the internal and  
external audit functions;
   the Group's framework for the identification 
and control of major risks, its risk and 
assurance mitigation plan and the annual 
assessment of control effectiveness;
   compliance with the Code of Ethics;
   corporate governance developments;
   the suitability of the Group's accounting 
policies and practices; and
   the status of material litigation involving  
the Group.
The Company's public financial statements  
are reviewed by the Committee in advance  
of their consideration by the Board.
External auditor's independence
The Committee has adopted a policy on the 
use of the external auditor for non-audit work. 
The external auditor may carry out certain 
specified non-audit work, in areas that have 
been pre-approved by the Committee, up  
to a monetary limit of half the audit fee per 
transaction and subject to an annual total cap 
of no more than the audit fee. Any other work 
for which management wishes to utilise the 
external auditor must be approved, subject  
to a de minimis limit, by the Committee or 
its chairman, or for engagements up to a 
monetary limit of  50,000, subject to an 
annual total cap of  100,000 by the Finance 
Director. Acquisition and vendor due-
diligence may only be provided by the 
External Auditor if specifically approved by  
the Committee on a case by case basis in 
advance of any engagement commencing. 
The pre-approved services may be 
summarised as follows:
   audit related services, including work related 
to the annual Group financial statements 
audit, subsidiary audits and local statutory 
accounts; and
   certain specified tax services, including tax 
compliance, tax planning and tax advice.
The External Auditor may not provide  
non-audit services in respect of:
   forensic investigation work into the affairs  
of the Group where there is the possibility  
of an accounting error or control breach in  
a period that has been reported on by the 
External Auditor;
   audit of the Group's Pension schemes;
   design of executive remuneration policy and 
incentive schemes, and recruitment services 
in respect of key management positions;
   tax planning assignments where the  
success of the tax scheme is reliant on the 
Group changing, or adopting, a specific 
accounting policy;
   bookkeeping or other services related  
to the accounting records or financial 
statements of the Group;
   financial information systems design  
and implementation;
   appraisal or valuation services, fairness 
opinions, or contribution-in-kind reports;
   actuarial services;
   internal audit outsourcing services;
   management functions or human resources;
   broker or dealer, investment adviser, or 
investment banking services; and
   legal services and expert services which 
may have an impact on the Company's 
financial performance or result in the 
auditor acting on behalf of the Company.
The Company operates a co-sourcing model 
in respect of the provision of internal audit 
services. Prior to their appointment as external 
auditor, Deloitte provided:
   internal audit services working in  
conjunction with the in house Group 
Assurance function; and
   other services in respect of compliance 
with tax regulations and provision of 
interim staff.
Full details regarding non-audit work are  
set out in note 4 to the financial statements  
on page 47.
Following their appointment as external 
auditor, Deloitte were replaced in respect  
of the provision of internal audit services  
by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP .
