MITIE Group PLC   
Annual Report  
and Accounts 2010
Audited information
The benefits of the Executive Directors who are members of the MITIE Group PLC Defined Benefit Pension Scheme are based on a 
pensionable salary capped at  123,600. The Company made contributions to the Group's defined benefit scheme on behalf of 
the three directors who are members of the scheme at a rate of 10% (2009: 10%) of the value of the benefit cap of  123,600. 
Following consultation with major shareholders in 2009 , the Committee approved a revision to the Chief Executive's pension  
benefit to bring its value into line with market practice and with effect from 1 April 2009 , Ruby McGregor-Smith received a salary 
supplement of 20% of salary.
Suzanne Baxter is not a member of the MITIE Group PLC Defined Benefit Pension Scheme as the scheme was closed to new 
entrants in 2005, before she joined the Group. It has always been the intention of the Remuneration Committee that the value of 
the pension benefits provided to Suzanne Baxter should mirror the value of the pension benefits provided to the other Executive 
Directors under the capped defined benefit arrangements, albeit that her benefits are provided through a separate defined 
contribution arrangement. Due to the differences in the nature of the Group's defined benefit scheme and the defined 
contribution scheme established for Suzanne Baxter, the cost to the Company of providing mirrored benefits for Suzanne Baxter is 
greater than the cost of providing the same value of benefits to the other Executive Directors under defined benefit arrangements. 
The contributions made by the Company into Suzanne Baxter's defined contribution scheme and the value of accrued benefits 
under the scheme have been reviewed during the year by the Remuneration Committee to ensure that the value of the benefits 
provided under that scheme mirror, as far as possible, the capped benefits of the defined benefit pension arrangements provided 
to the other Executive Directors. Pension contributions for Suzanne Baxter were 13.5% of base salary for the year ended 31 March 
2010 (2009: 13.5% of base salary) and were paid into a separate defined contribution pension scheme. With effect from 1 April 2009 , 
Suzanne Baxter received a salary supplement of 20% of base salary, following approval of the Remuneration Committee  
(see Table 1 ), in order to bring the value of her overall pension benefit into line with market practice.
