Corporate governance
Compliance with the Code of
Best Practice
In July 2003 a new Combined Code
was published by the Financial
Reporting Council. It derived from a
review of the role and effectiveness
of non-executive directors by Derek
Higgs and a review of audit 
committees by a group led by 
Sir Robert Smith. This new Code
applies for reporting years that begin
on or after 1 November 2003. This
Corporate Governance report refers
to the 1998 Combined Code 
prepared by the Committee on
Corporate Governance chaired by 
Sir Ronald Hampel.
Throughout the year ended 
31 December 2003, the Company
has been in compliance with the
Code provisions set out in section 1
of the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance, with the exception that
throughout the period both audit
and remuneration committees
included a part-time executive 
director (B.2.2 and D.3.1 of the
Combined Code). 
Statement about applying the
Principles of Good Corporate
Governance
The Company has applied the
Principles of Good Corporate
Governance set out in section 1 of
the Combined Code by complying
with the Code of Best Practice as
described above. Further explanation
of how the Principles have been
applied is set out below and, in 
connection with directors' 
remuneration, in the Directors' 
remuneration report. 
Board of Directors
The executive directors of the 
Company are fully involved with the
management of the Group at all 
levels, and the direction and control
of the Group remains firmly in their
hands.
The Board comprises a part-time
executive Chairman, M D Coster, 
two further executive directors, 
Chief Executive G S Philp and Group
Finance Director W S Greenhalgh,
and three non-executive directors, 
T M Lazenby, S J Cockrell and 
D Bogle. There were no changes to
the Board through the reporting year. 
A timetable for Board meetings is
agreed annually. The Board meets
formally six times a year and 
additionally as necessary. It is 
responsible for the business and
commercial strategy, monitoring
progress, the approval of major
transactions and the approval of
financial statements and operating
and capital expenditure budgets.
Comprehensive board papers, 
dealing with all aspects of the 
business, are distributed by the
Company Secretary in advance of
each board meeting. The Company's
Articles authorise any director to 
take independent professional 
advice if necessary at the Company's
expense and have access to the
advice and services of the Company
Secretary.
All three non-executive directors are
considered independent by virtue of
being free from management of the
Company or holding any material
interest in it. T M Lazenby is the 
senior independent director. The
directors consider that, under the
new Combined Code, S J Cockrell
will cease to be independent as he 
is a member of the Company 
pension scheme. The executive
Chairman is responsible for running
the Board. The Chief Executive is
responsible for running the business
of the Group and chairs the executive 
committee. Consequently there is 
a clear division of responsibilities at
the head of the Group.
All directors are required to seek 
re-election at the first Annual
General Meeting following 
appointment, and subsequently at 
an interval of not more than three
years. Two of the six directors will
offer themselves for re-election at
this year's AGM.
The Board has not seen the need to
introduce a formal Nomination
Committee this year, however when
a new appointment is required a
Nomination Committee will be put in
place and will be chaired by the
Chairman. There is already a formal
and transparent procedure for
appointing new directors. External
consultants and advisers are used to
identify a short list of suitable 
candidates, and all Board members
evaluate candidates. 
Audit committee
The audit committee comprises the
three non-executive directors, 
S J Cockrell, T M Lazenby and 
D Bogle and the part-time executive
Chairman, M D Coster, and is chaired
by S J Cockrell. Mr Coster's 
membership of the committee is in
contravention of B.2.2 of the
Combined Code as he is an executive
director. Mr Coster resigned as a
member of the committee on 
31 December 2003. The committee
examines and reviews, on behalf of
the Board, the internal financial 
controls, financial and accounting
policies and practices, the form and
content of financial reports and
statements, and the work of the
external auditors. The Chief Executive
and Group Finance Director attend
meetings of the audit committee by
invitation. Terms of reference for the
committee are in place and are 
available from the Company Secretary.
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee 
comprises the three non-executive
directors, S J Cockrell, T M Lazenby
and D Bogle and the part-time 
executive Chairman, M D Coster, 
and is chaired by T M Lazenby. 
Mr Coster's membership of the
committee is in contravention of
B.2.2 of the Combined Code as he 
is an executive director. Mr Coster
resigned from the committee on 
31 December 2003. 
The committee makes 
recommendations to the Board 
on the Group's policy for executive
remuneration and determines the
individual remuneration packages on
behalf of the Board for the 
executive directors of the Group.  18 The MTL Instruments Group plc
Corporate governance continued
The committee also reviews 
proposals from the Chief Executive
for the remuneration of the senior 
management team. The committee
has access to professional advice,
both inside and outside the 
Company, in furtherance of its
duties. The committee has appointed
New Bridge Street Consultants LLP
as advisors on remuneration issues.
Terms of reference for the 
committee are in place and are 
available from the Company
Secretary.
Constructive use of the AGM
All shareholders are invited to 
participate in the Annual General
Meeting. The Board uses the AGM 
as an opportunity to present to
shareholders an overview of the
Company's business. At last year's
AGM all members of the Board were
available to answer questions and
will be available again at the AGM 
on 6 May 2004.
Dialogue with institutional
investors
The directors seek to build on a
mutual understanding of objectives
between the Company and its 
institutional shareholders. Following
the announcement of six monthly
results, the Company arranges 
meetings with institutional 
shareholders in order to discuss 
the implications of the results. 
The Company is always available 
to participate in meetings with 
institutional shareholders at their
request.
The interim and preliminary
announcements are made available
promptly on the Company's website
(www.mtl-group.com).
Internal control
The Board has applied Principle D.2
of the Combined Code by 
establishing a continuous process for
identifying, evaluating and managing
the significant risks the Group faces.
The Board regularly reviews the
process, which has been in place
throughout the reporting year and
up to the date of approval of the
annual report and accounts and
which is in accordance with Internal
Control: Guidance for Directors on
the Combined Code published in
September 1999. The Board is
responsible for the Group's system
of internal control and for reviewing
its effectiveness. Such a system is
designed to manage rather than
eliminate the risk of failure to
achieve business objectives, and 
can only provide reasonable and 
not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
In compliance with the Provision
D.2.1 of the Combined Code, 
the Board regularly reviews the
effectiveness of the Group's system
of internal control. The Board's 
monitoring covers all controls,
including financial, operational 
and compliance controls and risk
management. It is based principally
on reviewing reports from 
management to consider whether
significant risks are identified, 
evaluated, managed and controlled
and whether significant weaknesses
are promptly remedied and indicate
a need for more extensive 
monitoring. Steps are being taken 
by the executive to embed internal
control and risk management further
into the operations of the business
and to deal with areas of 
improvement which come to 
management's and the Board's
attention. The Board has also 
performed a specific assessment for
the purpose of this annual report.
This assessment considers all 
significant aspects of internal control
arising during the period covered by
this report. The audit committee
assists the Board in discharging its
review responsibilities.
The Board has reviewed the need for
a formal internal audit function but
considers that the Company is not
large enough to justify a dedicated
resource. It has however determined
that a formal report be made 
available to the audit committee at
least annually for each operating unit
for 2004 and beyond. The report 
will cover an assessment of areas
including; internal controls, 
accounting policies, statutory 
compliance, accounting records,
financial statements, and judgements
and estimates implicit in the 
statements. 
Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors
have a reasonable expectation that
the Company and the Group have
adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason,
they continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the 
financial statements.
