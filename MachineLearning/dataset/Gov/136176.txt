Monitoring and Corrective Action
The Board regularly reviews the overall operations of the Company.  The Audit Committee is tasked to review the assurance 
procedures to obtain the level of assurance required and reports to the Board.
During the financial year, the Internal Audit function has been outsourced to a professional audit firm.  The Audit 
Committee has reviewed the internal audit programme before commencement of the internal audit. After completion 
of the internal audit, the results were presented to the Audit Committee for discussion as to whether or not appropriate 
action is to be taken. In addition, a non-executive director conducts regular field and office inspections and submits to 
the Board his written reports on the effectiveness and control procedures of estate operations. The Audit Committee and 
the Board also review the plantation visit reports submitted by the independent Visiting Agent, whose main duties are to 
assess the operations and condition of the estates twice a year.  The Audit Committee is of the opinion that the internal 
audit activities are adequately covered.
In respect of the period under review, the directors are not aware of any material internal control aspects of any significant 
problems which need to be disclosed in this report.

The Company's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are set out in the Business Review on pages 11. The financial position of the Company, its cash flows and liquidity 
position is shown in the Financial Statements and Notes to Financial statements on page 28 to page 65. In addition note 
21 to the financial statements includes the Company's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its 
financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Company has considerable financial resources together with a yearly renewable contract with a major oil mill. Suppliers 
of fertilizers and transporters are selected through open tender to control cost of operations. As a consequence, the 
directors believe that the Company is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain 
economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the annual report and accounts.
