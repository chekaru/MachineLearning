obligations.

Board members are required to attend meetings regularly in

accordingly can contribute to meetings. Directors are informed 
of proposed meeting dates well in advance. Directors are sent 
papers for meetings of the Board and for those committees of 
which they are a member. Guidelines are in place concerning 
the content, timeliness and preferred presentation of papers to 
ensure Directors are briefed appropriately. 
Board performance evaluation 
The Board of the Company instigated a review of its 
performance over the year to 31
st

rigorous evaluation of the performance of the Board and the 
Directors.  
A positive set of results was recorded across the survey 
indicating the Board is working effectively.

effective leadership and performed his responsibilities well, that

The Transmission Executive Committee has a number of sub-
committees dealing with matters such as investment 
governance and coordination of operations. 
Finance committee 
The Finance Committee of the Board is responsible for setting 
policy and grants authority for financing decisions, bank 
accounts, credit exposure, control mechanisms for hedging and 
foreign exchange transactions, guarantees and indemnities and 
approves, or if appropriate, recommends to the Board other 
treasury, tax, pensions and insurance strategies. 
Group holding company 
During the year, two of the Directors, Nick Winser, and Mark 
Fairbairn, until his resignation in March 2011, were also 
Executive Directors of National Grid plc. Through participation 
of these Directors at the Board of both companies, the Board of 
National Grid Gas is well placed to identify and facilitate 
understanding of the views of its shareholder. 
Risk management and internal control 
The Board of National Grid plc takes overall responsibility for 
internal control throughout its group operations and in particular 
in monitoring its effectiveness within its subsidiary companies.  
The system of internal control, and in particular our risk 
management policies, has been designed to manage rather 
than eliminate risks to the achievement of our strategic and 
business objectives. 
During the year, the Board of National Grid plc has undertaken 
a review of the internal control processes, including those of the 
Company, and their effectiveness. 
Risk management 
The Company has embedded risk management into its 
business decision making process.  This risk management 
process continues to be based on both bottom-up and top-down 
assessments of operational, including safety, financial and 
other business or project risks. From the bottom-up, business 
units prepare and maintain risk registers that capture their key 
risks and the actions being taken to manage them. These risk 
registers are regularly reviewed and discussed by the executive 
committees for those business units.  Directors and other senior 
management are involved at critical stages in the review 
process. Their review and debate of the outputs of the bottom-
up assessment against their top-down views produce an overall 
evaluation of the risks that are faced by the Company. In 
addition, the Executive, the Risk & Responsibility and the Audit 
Committees of National Grid plc review National Grid's overall 
risk profile and any changes, the Audit Committee reviews the 
overall risk management process. 
Compliance management 
Compliance management is undertaken on a National Grid 
wide basis. This process provides assurance to Directors and 
senior management on the effectiveness of control frameworks 
to manage key internal and external obligations and also 
highlights instances of significant non-compliance with these 
obligations. External obligations are driven primarily by key 
legal and regulatory requirements whereas internal obligations 
focus more on compliance with National Grid's own corporate 
policies and procedures, which included regulatory compliances 
policies. The compliance management process is consistent 
with and complimentary to the risk management process. 
Internal audit 
The Company does not have a separate internal audit function.  
This function is provided by National Grid's corporate audit 
function. 
Business separation 
Special Condition C20 of our NTS gas transporter licence 
requires that the Company maintains managerial and 
operational systems such that: 
 the DN businesses do not gain unfair commercial 
advantage by reason of the way the Company conducts its 
NTS business, as required by Standard Special Condition 
A6; and  
 cross-subsidy between the NTS business and the DN 
businesses is avoided, as required by Standard Special 
Condition A35. 
Our policy on business separation is set out in the Company's 
Compliance Statement.   National Grid Gas plc  NTS Regulatory accounting statements 2010/11  29 
  
We have taken the following specific actions to comply with the 
requirements of Special Condition C20: 
 established separate management for the gas 
transmission and gas distribution businesses, as 
described above; 
 appointed separate Compliance Committees for each of 
the gas transmission business and the gas distribution 
business. Each Compliance Committee reports directly to 
the Board of National Grid Gas and also to the Audit 
Committee of National Grid; and 
 appointed a Business Separation Compliance Officer, who 
reports to the Compliance Committees and twice yearly to 
the Audit Committee of National Grid.
