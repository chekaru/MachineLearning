 Notice of meeting
Explanatory notes to resolutions 6 and 7
Resolution 6 is proposed as an ordinary resolution to renew 
the directors' authority to allot shares and other relevant
securities up to an aggregate nominal amount of  3,392,909
(which represents 18.8% of the total issued ordinary share
capital of the company at the date of this notice). The authority
will last until next year's annual general meeting or 15 months
after the passing of the resolution, whichever is the earlier .
This is standard practice for many public companies. The
directors have no present intention of exercising this authority.
If shares are to be allotted under this authority and are to be
paid for in cash, Section 89(1) of the Companies Act 1985
requires that those shares are offered first to existing
shareholders in proportion to the number of shares that they
hold at that time. This is the statutory pre-emption right of
existing shareholders . There may be circumstances when it 
is in the interest of the company for the directors to be able to
allot some of the shares for cash other than in proportion to
the holdings of existing shareholders.
Resolution 7, which is proposed as a special resolution, gives
the directors authority to disapply the statutory pre-emption
rights of existing shareholders. The resolution gives the
directors the power to allot shares and other equity securities
for cash other than in proportion to the holdings of existing
shareholders up to a maximum nominal value of  903,738,
representing approximately 5% of the company's issued
ordinary share capital at the date of this notice, which is in
accordance with the guidelines issued by insitutional investors.
The resolution also gives the directors the power to allot
shares for cash in connection with a rights issue or any other
offer on a pre-emptive basis in favour of holders of ordinary
shares, subject to the exclusions and arrangements set down
in the resolution. This disapplication of pre-emption rights will
last until next year's annual general meeting or 15 months
after the passing of the resolution, whichever is earlier .
Notes
A member entitled to attend and vote at this meeting is entitled
to appoint one or more proxies to attend and, on a poll, vote 
in his stead. A proxy need not be a member of the company. 
A form of proxy is enclosed with this notice for your use in
connection with the meeting. To be effective, the instrument
appointing a proxy and the power of attorney or other authority,

registrars not later than 48 hours before the time appointed for
the meeting. The company, pursuant to regulation 41 of the
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, specifies that only
those ordinary shareholders registered in the register of
members of the company as at 3.30pm on 17 May 2003, or in
the event that the meeting is adjourned, in such register 48
hours before the time of any adjourned meeting, shall be
entitled to attend or vote at the meeting in respect of the
number of shares registered in their name at the relevant time.
Changes to entries in the register of members after 3.30pm on
17 May 2003 or, in the event that the meeting is adjourned, in
such register less than 48 hours before the time of any
adjourned meeting, shall be disregarded in determining the
rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting. Copies of
all the directors' service contracts are available for inspection
at the company's registered office during normal business
hours on business days from the date of this notice until the
close of the meeting and will be available for inspection at the
place of the meeting for 15 minutes before the meeting and
during the meeting.

Special business
As special business to consider and, if thought fit, to pass the
following resolutions of which resolution 6 will be proposed as an

resolution. 
Ordinary resolution
6 That the Board of directors (the Board) be and is hereby
generally and unconditionally authorised to exercise all
powers of the company to allot relevant securities (within the
meaning of Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 (the Act))
up to an aggregate nominal amount of  3,392,909 provided
that the authority hereby conferred shall expire 15 months
after the passing of this resolution or on the conclusion of the
annual general meeting of the company held in 2004,
whichever first occurs, unless this authority is renewed, varied
or revoked before such expiry by the company in general
meeting, save that the company may at any time before such
expiry make an offer or agreement which would or might
require any relevant securities to be allotted after such expiry,
and the Board may allot relevant securities in pursuance of
such offer or agreement as if the authority hereby conferred
had not expired.
Special resolution
7 That, subject to the passing of resolution 6 above, the Board
be and is hereby empowered pursuant to Section 95 of the Act
to allot equity securities (within the meaning of Section 94 of
the Act) for cash, pursuant to the authority conferred by that
resolution, as if Section 89(1) of the Act did not apply to any
such allotment, provided that this power be limited to:
a) the allotment of equity securities in connection with an offer
by way of rights or any other offer on a pre-emptive basis in
favour of holders of ordinary shares where the equity
securities comprised in that offer are offered to the holders
of ordinary shares on a fixed record date in proportion (as
nearly as may be) to the respective numbers of such shares
held by them on that date, but subject to such exclusions or
other arrangements as the directors may deem necessary
or expedient to deal with any legal or practical problems
under the laws of any overseas territory or the requirements
of any regulatory body or any stock exchange in any territory
or in relation to fractional entitlements; and
b) the allotment (other than pursuant to sub-paragraph (a)
above) of equity securities having, in the case of relevant
shares, a nominal amount, or in the case of other equity
securities giving the right to subscribe for or convert into
relevant shares having a nominal amount, not exceeding in
aggregate the sum of  903,738 (representing approximately
5% of the issued share capital of the company at the date of
the notice of meeting in which this resolution appears)
provided always that the power conferred by this resolution
shall expire on the earlier of the date falling 15 months
following the passing of this resolution and the date of the
annual general meeting of the company held in 2004, save
that the company may before such expiry make an offer or
agreement which would or might require equity securities to
be allotted after such expiry, and the Board may allot equity
securities in pursuance of such offer or agreement as if the
power conferred hereby had not expired.
