 The Company's securities are traded
on the Alternative Investment Market
(AIM). The Group has adopted the
Quoted Company alliance (QCA )
corporate governance guidelines 
for AIM companies as published in
July 2005.
Following is a brief description of the
role of the Board and its Committees,
followed by details of the Group's
systems of internal financial control,
which the Board continue to keep
under review.
The Board
The Board of directors of Nighthawk
Energy plc consists of two non-
executive directors and two
executive directors and is responsible
for the proper management of the
Group. The Board will meet at least
four times in the coming year to
review trading performance and
budgets, ensure adequate funding,
set and monitor strategy, examine
acquisition opportunities and report
to shareholders. The Board has 
a formal schedule of matters
specifically reserved to it for
decisions. The roles of non-executive
Chairman and Managing Director 
are separate and their responsibilities
independently defined. 
The following Committees deal 
with specific aspects of the 
Group's affairs:
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee
comprises two non-executive
directors, Dr Roger Norwich, who
acts as its Chairman and Geoffrey
Metzger. It determines the
employment terms and total
remuneration of the executive
directors and senior management.
The Committee makes
recommendations to the Board on
overall remuneration for executive
directors in order to attract, retain
and motivate high quality executives
capable of achieving the Group's
objectives. The package comprises
basic salary, pension and share
options. No performance related
bonus is paid. Directors'
remuneration for the year is 
shown in note 4 on page 39.
Those disclosures form part 
of this report.
The Board determines the
remuneration of the non-executive
directors.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises
Geoffrey Metzger, who acts as its
Chairman and Dr Roger Norwich. The
Committee is responsible for a wide
range of financial matters. It monitors
the controls that are in place to
ensure the integrity of the financial
information reported to shareholders.
This Committee also provides a
forum for reporting by the Group's
auditors. The executive directors
attend meetings by invitation.
Internal Financial Control
The directors are responsible for
establishing and maintaining the
Group's internal financial control
systems. These are designed to meet
the particular needs of the Group
and the risks to which it is exposed,
and by their nature can provide
reasonable but not absolute
assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
The key procedures that the directors
have established to provide effective
internal financial controls are:
  Corporate Accounting 
and Procedures 
Responsibilities are communicated
throughout the Group as part 
of the corporate communication
procedure. Delegation of authority
and authorisation limits,
segregation of duties and other
control procedures, together with
the Company culture are included
in these communications, and
standard accounting procedures
are in place to reflect this.
  Quality and Integrity of Personnel 
The integrity and competence of
personnel is ensured through high
recruitment standards and
subsequent training. The quality of
personnel is regarded as a critical
part of the control environment
and the ethical standards expected
are communicated through senior
members of staff and other
communication channels.
  Identification of Business Risks 
The Board is responsible for
identifying the major business
risks faced by the Group and for
determining the appropriate course
of action to manage these risks.
  Financial Reporting 
The Group has a comprehensive
system for reporting financial
results to the Board.
  Investment Appraisal 
Capital expenditure is regulated 
by authorisation limits. For
expenditure beyond the specified
limits, detailed proposals are
submitted to the Board. If an
interest in a new project is being
acquired, appropriate due diligence
is undertaken.
  Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee monitors
through reports made to it, the
controls that are in force and 
any perceived gaps in the control
environment. The Audit Committee
also considers and determines
relevant action in respect of 
any control issues raised by 
the external auditors.
Going Concern
The directors have a reasonable
expectation that the Group has
adequate resources to enable it 
to continue in operational existence
for the foreseeable future. For this
reason, they continue to adopt the
going concern basis in preparing 
the accounts.

ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2008
We have audited the Group financial
statements of Nighthawk Energy plc
for the year ended 30 June 2008
which comprise the principal
accounting policies, the consolidated
income statement, the consolidated
balance sheet, the consolidated
statement of recognised income and
expense, the consolidated cash flow
statement and notes 1 to 30. These
Group financial statements have been
prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein. 
We have reported separately on the
parent company financial statements
of Nighthawk Energy plc for the year
ended 30 June 2008. 
This report is made solely to the
Company's members, as a body, 
in accordance with Section 235 
of the Companies Act 1985. Our 
audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the
Company's members those matters
we are required to state to them 
in an auditor's report and for no
other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept
or assume responsibility to anyone
other than the Company and the
Company's members as a body, 
for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective Responsibilities 
of Directors and Auditors
The directors' responsibilities for
preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group financial statements in
accordance with United Kingdom 
law and International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as
adopted by the European Union 
are set out in the Statement 
of Directors' Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the
Group financial statements in
accordance with relevant legal 
and regulatory requirements 
and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as 
to whether the Group financial
statements give a true and fair view
and whether the Group financial
statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985. We also report
to you whether in our opinion the
information given in the Report of
the Directors is consistent with the
financial statements. The information
given in the Report of the Directors
includes that specific information
presented in the Managing Director's
Statement and Review of Operations
that is cross referred from the
Business Review section of the
Report of the Directors.
In addition we report to you if, in 
our opinion, we have not received all
the information and explanations we
require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding directors'
remuneration and other transactions
is not disclosed. 
We read other information contained
in the Annual Report and consider
whether it is consistent with the
audited Group financial statements.
The other information comprises only
the Managing Director's Statement,
Review of Operations, the Report 
of the Directors, and the Corporate
Governance Report. We consider 
the implications for our report 
if we become aware of any 
apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the Group
financial statements. Our
responsibilities do not extend 
to any other information.
Basis of Audit Opinion
We conducted our audit in
accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and
Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of
evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the Group 
financial statements. It also includes
an assessment of the significant
estimates and judgments made 
by the directors in the preparation 
of the Group financial statements,
and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the
Group's circumstances, consistently
applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our 
audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which
we considered necessary in order 
to provide us with sufficient evidence
to give reasonable assurance that the
Group financial statements are free
from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity
or error. In forming our opinion we
also evaluated the overall adequacy
of the presentation of information 
in the Group financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
  the Group financial statements
give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRS as adopted
by the European Union, of the
state of the Group's affairs as 
at 30 June 2008 and of its loss
for the year then ended;
  the Group financial statements
have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985; and 
  the information given in the
Report of the Directors is
consistent with the financial
statements.
