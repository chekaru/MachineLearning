 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
This company is committed to the principles of corporate governance contained in the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance  which is appended to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and for which the board is 
accountable to shareholders.
The Listing Rules require the company to disclose how it has applied the 14 Principles of Good Governance and to 
explain the extent to which the Code Provisions have been complied with during the accounting period.
COMPLIANCE STATEMENT
The UK Listing Authority's Rules require that the board reports on the company's compliance with the Code provisions 
throughout the accounting year. The directors believe that the company has complied with the Code throughout the 
year except as detailed below.
The board has not established a Nominations Committee. At the year end the board of the company comprised four 
directors, two of whom were non-executive. At this size, the board considers that the board as a whole can handle 
recommendations on all new board appointments in an effective manner. 
During the year the Audit Committee comprised the two non executive directors.   
The arrangements by which company staff may raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial 
reporting or other matters were not considered or formalised until after the end of the year. This review has taken place 
during September 2007.
Non executive directors - during the year to 30 June 2007, the non executive directors comprised Mr A. Caplin 
and Mr R. Heath. Mr A. Caplin has been a  non executive director for nine years and has a substantial shareholding 
in the company, the board considers that because of Mr A. Caplin's wide range of  other interests in the corporate 
sector,  these facts of themselves has not in any way impeded his independence
 
DIRECTORS
Board of Directors
The company is led and controlled through the Board of Directors, which during last year comprised two executive 
and two non-executive directors. Biographical details of each director in office during the year appear on page 19.  The 
roles of the chairman and managing director are separate such that there is an adequate division of responsibilities at 
senior board level.
All directors have access to the advice and services of the company secretary and the board has established a procedure 
whereby any director may seek independent professional advice in the furtherance of his duties at the company's 
expense.
As required by the company's articles of association, directors offer themselves for re-election at least once every 
three years.
Non-executive Directors
Subject to the compliance statement above ,the board considers that  the non-executive directors were independent 
throughout the year. The non-executive directors actively contribute to the functioning of the board and bring a 
range of views and experience from different fields.
14 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

board is responsible for the overall direction and strategy of the group to secure optimum performance. The board 
has specified those areas of operations in the group which are specifically in its domain and may not be delegated; 
these include the appointment and removal of the company secretary.
All board members receive weekly summary financial information and monthly management accounts.  Additional 
ad hoc reports on other matters are received and considered as appropriate.

Board Committees
  Audit Committee
 The Audit Committee, chaired by Mr A.L. Caplin, comprised the non-executive directors. The company 
secretary acts as secretary to the committee. The audit committee meets with the external auditors at least once 
a year. The committee's responsibilities include monitoring the relationships with external auditors, reviewing 
the group's statutory accounts and other published financial information, monitoring compliance with statutory 
and UK Listing Authority requirements and instigating other projects as it sees fit. The terms of reference of 
the audit committee have been reviewed and are available on request by writing to the Company Secretary at 
the registered address. 
  Remuneration Committee
 At the year end the Remuneration Committee comprised both non-executive directors, Mr R.F. Heath 
(Chairman) and Mr A.L. Caplin.  The company secretary acts as secretary to the committee. The committee 
meets at least once a year and is responsible for setting the remuneration policy and annual salaries that apply 
to executive directors.
  Operations Committee
 The Operations Committee comprises the executive directors and certain senior business managers.  It meets 
weekly under the chairmanship of Mr H.W. Matthews, the managing director, and deals with the major decisions 
of the group other than those dealt with by the Remuneration and Audit Committees or by the full board.
Board Effectiveness
Under the new Combined Code, the board is required each year to carry out a formal and rigorous evaluation of its 
own performance and that of its committees and individual directors. In July 2006 the chairman led an evaluation of 
the board's performance. The evaluation included a review of the role and structure of the board, board and committee 
meetings, processes, corporate governance issues and an assessment of the contribution of individual directors. The 
results of the evaluation were presented to the board by the chairman. The board considered the issues identified and 
during the year to end June 2007 has taken action to address those issues.
15 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
GOING CONCERN BASIS
After making enquiries, the directors have formed a judgement, at the time of approving the financial statements, that 
there is a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. For this reason the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The directors, particularly the chairman, attend meetings with the company's institutional shareholders throughout 
the year. Formal presentations are made to analysts and institutional shareholders following the announcement of the 
annual and interim results to discuss issues and obtain feedback.
Notice of the Annual General Meeting (AGM) is circulated to all shareholders at least 20 working days prior to the 
meeting. Directors attend the AGM and will be available to answer shareholders' questions.
ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT
Financial Reporting
The board believes that its Annual Reports and Accounts represent a balanced and understandable assessment of the 
group's and company's position and prospects whilst also complying with the legal and regulatory requirements for 
financial reporting relevant to the company.
Internal Control
The board of directors has overall responsibility for the group's systems of internal control and for monitoring  
their effectiveness.
The board maintains full control and direction over appropriate strategic, financial, organisational and compliance 
issues and has put in place an organisational structure with formally defined lines of responsibilities and delegation 
of authority. There are established procedures for planning, capital expenditure, information and reporting systems 
and for monitoring the group's business and its performance. The board has delegated to executive management the 
implementation of the systems of internal  control within an established framework that applies within the group.
The group's control systems address key business and financial risks. The board considers the greatest risks to be related 
to the realisable value of current assets, principally stock and debtors. Particular attention is paid to all matters relating 
to purchasing, stock, sales, debtors, cash, capital expenditure and foreign exchange. Comprehensive documented 
procedures are used and are available to all staff via the extensive computer system.
A system of control is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, 
and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. As and when areas 
of improvement are brought to the attention of the board and management steps are taken to further embed internal 
control and risk management into the operations of the business.
16 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The board has considered the need for internal audit but has decided that because of the size of the group it cannot be 
justified at present.
A review of internal control was undertaken by the board in September 2006,  a further review of the control procedures 
and risk factors pertaining to the company was undertaken in July 2007.  The conclusions of both these reviews were 
that the systems and operations of the internal controls remained effective and appropriate to the operations of the 
company
