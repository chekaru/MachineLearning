Membership of the Committee is reviewed by the Chairman of the 
Committee and the Company Chairman, who is not a member of 
the Audit Committee, at regular intervals and they recommend new 
appointments to the Committee. The Committee is currently 
comprised of four Non-Executive Directors and two members 
constitute a quorum. The Board considers that the Chairman of the 
Committee has recent and relevant financial experience through his 
career in business and his appointment to other Boards.
The Company has a policy of providing training to Directors where 
required. Ongoing training can include attendance at formal 
conferences, internal briefings, briefings by external advisers and 
visits by Directors to operations in the business.
The Board expects the Audit Committee members to have an 
understanding of:
the principles of, contents of, and developments in financial reporting including the applicable accounting standards;
key aspects of the Group's operations including corporate policies, Group financing, and systems of internal control;
matters that influence or distort the presentation of accounts; the principles of, and developments in, company law, sector- specific laws and other relevant corporate legislation;
the role of internal and external auditing and risk management; the regulatory framework for the Group's businesses; and environmental and social responsibility best practices. Meetings
The Audit Committee meets at least twice a year and has an 
agenda linked to events in the Group's financial calendar, including 
a review of the Group's annual and half yearly results, the review of 
the internal controls of the Group and ensuring that the financial 
performance of the Group is properly reported on and monitored. 
The agenda is predominantly cyclical and is approved by the Audit 
Committee Chairman in advance of each meeting. Each Audit 
Committee member has the right to require reports on matters of 
interest in addition to the routine items.
The Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and a 
representative of the External Auditors are invited to attend 
meetings of the Audit Committee and attended all Audit 
Committee meetings held in 2008. Senior management present 
such reports as are requested by the Committee to enable it to 
discharge its duties.

reviewed the risks associated with the Group's business. External Auditors
The Audit Committee is responsible for the development, 
implementation and monitoring of the Group's policy on external 
audit. The policy assigns oversight responsibility for monitoring the 
independence, objectivity and compliance with ethical and 
regulatory requirements to the Audit Committee, and day-to-day 
responsibility to the Group Finance Director. 
The Group's policy on external audit sets out the categories of 
non-audit services which the External Auditors will and will not be 
allowed to provide to the Group, subject to de minimis levels and 
Audit Committee Chairman approval in emergency situations.
To fulfil its responsibility regarding the independence of the 
External Auditors, the Audit Committee reviewed:
the changes in key external audit staff in the External Auditors' plan for the current year;
the arrangements for day-to-day management of the audit relationship; and
the overall extent of non-audit services provided by the External Auditors, in addition to their case by case approval of the 
provision of non-audit services by the External Auditors.
To assess the effectiveness of the External Auditors, the Audit 
Committee reviewed:
the External Auditors' fulfilment of the agreed audit plan and variations from the plan; and
the robustness and perceptiveness of the auditors in their handling of the key accounting and audit judgements.
As a consequence of its satisfaction with the results of the activities 
outlined above, the Audit Committee has recommended to the 
Board that the External Auditors are re-appointed.
Internal Audit Function
The Group does not currently have an Internal Audit function since 
the scale and operations of the Group are such that there is 
currently deemed no requirement for an Internal Audit function. 
The Audit Committee is required to review the Group's internal 
financial controls and, where required, review the Group's internal 
control and risk management systems and statement on internal 
control systems prior to endorsement by the Board.
Overview
As a result of its work during the year, the Audit Committee has 
concluded that it has acted in accordance with its terms of 
reference and has ensured the independence and objectivity of the 
External Auditors.
It is intended that the Chairman of the Audit Committee will be 
available at this year's Annual General Meeting to answer any 
questions about the work of the Committee.
