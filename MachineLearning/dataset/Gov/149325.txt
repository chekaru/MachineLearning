Corporate governance statement
Penna Consulting Plc
Annual Report 2005
The Group is committed to the principles of corporate governance contained in
the revised Combined Code on Corporate Governance which was published in
July 2003 by the Financial Reporting Council and which is appended to the
Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. The Board is accountable to the
Company's shareholders for corporate governance and confirms that there 
is a process in place for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant
risks to the achievement of the Group's strategic objectives on an ongoing 
basis. The process has been in place throughout the year. This statement
describes how the relevant principles of corporate governance are applied to 
the Company and the Company's compliance throughout the year with the
provisions set out in Section 1 of the revised Combined Code.
We have a policy of dividing responsibilities for the Board and running the
Company's business by appointing a Chairman, a senior independent director
and a Chief Executive. The Chief Executive and the Finance Director 
form part of an operations board which is responsible for running the operations
of the Company.
The Workings of the Board and its Committees
The Board of Directors meets at least eight times a year, and also has telephone
conferences as considered necessary. The Non-Executive Directors may meet
without the Executive Directors being present if required.
The Board has a balance of skills and experience appropriate to its size and
business. It is made up of two Executive Directors and currently six Non-
Executive Directors of whom three (Sir James Harvie-Watt, Bt, David Banks and
Richard Stillwell) are deemed by the Company to be independent of
management and free from any business or other relationships which could
materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. Their
overriding duty is to ensure the operations conducted by the company and the
procedures followed reflect the best interests of the Company's shareholders. The
biographies of the Board of Directors appear on page 6. In the event that there
is a need to express concerns to the Board other than through the Chairman,
the Board has appointed Richard Stillwell as the Senior Independent Director to
whom such concerns can be conveyed.
The Board has sought to ensure that Directors are properly briefed on issues
arising at Board meetings by; distributing a formal schedule of matters assigned
to each Board meeting which is circulated at the beginning of each year; a more
detailed agenda together with the Board papers is circulated at least seven days
before each Board meeting; considering the adequacy of the information
provided before making decisions; adjourning meetings or deferring decisions
when Directors require further information; encouraging Directors to talk to any
other key executives or seek further information in order to keep them as
informed as they deem appropriate; having key executives attend Board
meetings to share information and encourage debate with Board members.
The Board has delegated specific authorities to an Audit Committee and 
a Remuneration Committee.
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee operates under written terms of reference which are freely
available from the Company Secretary on request. The Committee is chaired by
Sir James Harvie-Watt and is composed of Allen Thomas, Richard Stillwell and
David Banks. The Chief Executive and the Finance Director attend as requested
by the Committee.
The Committee normally meets before the Company's interim and annual
accounts are submitted to the Board for approval. The Committee meets
annually without management with the Company's auditors to ensure any
concerns the auditors may have are fully expressed. The Committee also
recommends the appointment and reviews the fees of external auditors,
including non-audit related fees, and considers the independence of the 
external auditors.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee operates under written terms of reference.
The Committee is composed of Non-Executive Directors deemed by the Board 
to be independent of management and is chaired by Richard Stillwell and meets
periodically to approve the remuneration for the Executive Directors and to
discuss the remuneration of senior employees. The Committee sets general 
policies on behalf of the Board in connection with salaries, bonuses, options 
and employee benefits. The Remuneration Report is on pages 10 to 13.
Nominations Committee
It is deemed appropriate for all members of the Board to participate in the
recruitment of members of the Board. There is a formal, rigorous and transparent
procedure for appointing new directors to the Board. A personality, skills and
experience specification is drawn up in the context of the skills and experience
which are deemed to be needed in a new Board Director, against which a short
list of candidates is matched, and full competency based interviews take place
before all Board members interview candidates. All new Board members
undertake a three-day familiarisation process. This involves visits to several
Penna locations and meeting a number of Penna people in order to get as full
an understanding of the business and the issues it faces as possible. The terms
and conditions of appointment of non-executive Directors are available for
inspection at the Company's registered office during normal business hours and
at the AGM.

Annual Report 2005
Maintenance of a sound system of Internal Control
In applying Principle D.2 of the Combined Code, the Board should maintain a
sound system of internal control to safeguard shareholders' investments and the
Company's assets. The Directors recognise that they have overall responsibility
for ensuring that the Group maintains a system of internal control to provide
them with reasonable assurance regarding effective and efficient operations,
internal financial control and compliance with laws and regulations. However,
there are inherent limitations in any system of internal control and, accordingly,
even the most effective system can provide only reasonable, and not absolute,
assurance against material mis-statement or loss.
For the full year the Board has complied with the procedures recommended by the
guidance on internal control issued by the Turnbull Committee. The processes used
by the Board to review the effectiveness of the system of internal control include:
 
Monthly meetings of the operations board which are subsequently reported to
the Board 
 
Discussions with management on risk areas identified by management and/or
the audit process 
 
Discussions and review of the issues arising from internal and external audits 
 
The review of significant Group risks.
The Audit Committee reports to the Board the results of their review of the risk
assessment process. The Board concludes on the overall effectiveness of all
internal controls.
The key features of the internal financial control system that operated throughout
the period are described below:
 
Comprehensive planning system, annually approved by the Board 
 
The reporting of business performance by operations directors 
 
Monthly financial reporting comparing actual performance against plan 
and against the prior year's results on a monthly and year-to-date basis 
 
Regular consideration by the Board of actual performance against budgets 
and business plans 
 
Ongoing discussions with the head of each discipline within the organisation
 
A review of the financial controls across the Group 
 
Regular reporting of legal and accounting developments to the Board 
 
The definition of lines of responsibility and delegation of authority
 
The setting of authorisation limits.
The Board carefully reviews the business plans and budgets. Material capital
expenditure and other large commitments in excess of approved plans are
subject to approval by the Board.
Given the Group's size and the nature of the Group's business, the Board does
not consider that it would be appropriate to have its own internal audit function
at present. Instead, the audit of internal financial controls form part of the
responsibilities of the central group finance function.
Relations with Shareholders
Communications with shareholders are given high priority. The Chairman's
statement on pages 1 to 5 includes a detailed review of the business. There is
regular dialogue with institutional shareholders including presentations after the
Company's preliminary announcement of the year-end results and at the half year.
Feedback from investors is encouraged and is shared with all Board members.
Information about Group companies and up to date news on the Group's 
services and activities is also accessible via the Penna Consulting web site
(www.e-penna.com).
The Board uses the Annual General Meeting to communicate with private and
institutional investors and welcomes their participation. The Board aims to
ensure that all the Non-Executive Directors are available at Annual General
Meetings to answer questions. Details of resolutions to be proposed at the
Annual General Meeting on 15 September 2005 can be found in the Notice 
of Annual General Meeting.
Compliance Statement
The UK Listing Authority's Rules require that the Board reports on the Company's
compliance with the Code provisions set out in Section 1 of the revised
Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued by the Financial Reporting
Council in July 2003, throughout the accounting period. The Directors believe
that the Company has complied with the Code throughout the year except as
detailed below.
Until 2 June 2004, Suzie Mumm  was both Chairman and Chief Executive. On
this date Sir James Harvie-Watt was appointed Chairman and remained as
Chairman until Stephen Rowlinson was appointed as Chairman on 21 February
2005. Suzie Mumm  resigned as Chief Executive on that date and Gary
Browning was appointed in her stead. Richard Stillwell is the Senior Independent
Director. At the date of Mr Rowlinson's appointment as Chairman he had no
other significant commitments.
During the year the Board did not conduct any formal evaluations of its
performance or of individual directors. It is intended that the Board will conduct
formal evaluations in the future.
