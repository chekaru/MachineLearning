Liquidity risk
The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of an 
overdraft. The Group's policy is to ensure that there is sufficient funding in place to meet foreseeable peak 
borrowing requirements. 
Foreign currency risk
A number of hedging transactions were entered into in Canadian Dollars and US Dollars to limit the exposure of 
foreign currency fluctuations.
The table below shows the Group's currency exposures, in other words those transactional (or non-structural) 
exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account. Such 
exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the 
operating (or  functional') currency of the operating unit involved.
As at 31 December 2006, these currency exposures were as follows:
2006 2005
  
Net foreign currency monetary assets.
US Dollar 843,104 807,578
Canadian Dollar 1,420,136 413,987

Euro 352,270 43,501
Israeli Shekel 15,737 18,597
2,737,277 1,330,965
As at 31 December 2006, the Group also held forward foreign currency contracts of  1,052,932 (2005:  1,424,133) 
to hedge expected settlements of foreign currency debtor balances due within one year. The unrealised gain at the 
year end was  59,936 (2005:  2,511).

The fair value of options granted to employees during the period was determined using the standard binomial  option 
pricing valuation model as  48,667 (2005:  469,750). The significant inputs into the model were the exercise price 
shown above, risk free interest rate of between 3.75% and 5% depending on the date of grant of the options, a 
dividend yield of zero, volatility of the share price based on the share price volatility for a comparable Group of 
companies for the last ten years and an estimate of forfeiture based on historical leaver information.
