 In June 1998, the Hampel Committee and the London Stock
Exchange published the Principles of Good Governance and
Code of Best Practice ( the Combined Code') which embraces
the work of the Cadbury, Greenbury and Hampel Committees
and became effective in respect of accounting periods ending
on or after 31 December 1998. In July 2003 the UK Listing
Authority published the new Combined Code ( the new code').
Although the Group is not governed by the Listing Rules of the
UK Listing Authority the directors have given consideration to
the Combined Code and the new code and have applied its
principles where appropriate for the limited size of the Group
and its position as described below.
The Board and its committees 
The Board
The composition of the Board is set out on page 16 and 17.
The Board comprises a Non Executive Chairman plus up to
three Executive Directors and four further Non Executive
Directors. The Board meets regularly and has a formal
schedule of matters which are reserved for its decision. It has
delegated specific responsibilities to the Remuneration and
Audit Committees which have specific terms of reference
approved by the Board. Board and Committee papers are
circulated in advance of each meeting and are supplemented
by reports and presentations so that all Directors are fully
briefed and provided with the information they need. All
Directors may take independent professional advice in
furtherance of their duties at the Company's expense.
The primary function of the Board is to set Group strategy 
and to oversee the effective implementation of that strategy.
The Board meets regularly throughout the year with an
established agenda of items dealing with important aspects
of the Group's affairs including monitoring strategy, approving
acquisitions and disposals, management performance, major
capital and development expenditure, approving budgets and
significant financing matters. The Board monitors exposures
to key business risks and reviews business performance
against strategic and budgetary goals and development
programmes. The Board also considers employee issues,
key appointments and reporting to shareholders.
Details of the Directors' service contracts are given in the
Report of the Remuneration Committee.
Division of responsibilities
The Board structure provides demonstrable separation of
executive responsibility for running the business and
responsibility for running the Board. This structure ensures
there is appropriate accountability to the Board and helps
safeguard the independence and objectivity of the Board.
The Board has delegated specific responsibilities to two
principal Committees, each of which has written terms of
reference. In line with best practice, the terms of reference
of the following committees have been the subject to review
within the last 12 months.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises John O'Connell (Chairman)
and Rob Stavis. The role of the Audit Committee is key both
to ensuring that a sound system of internal control is
maintained within the Group and to ensuring that Portrait
Software plc presents (and its policies support) a balanced,
clear and understandable assessment of its position and
prospects. The Audit Committee meets twice a year and more
frequently if required.
The Committee examines the process of financial reporting
within the Group. It reviews annually the adequacy of the
Group's system of internal controls and the processes for
monitoring and evaluating the risks facing the Group. The
Committee reviews the scope and results of the audit, as 
well as the fees of the auditors for both audit and non-audit
services. The Committee is authorised to seek information
from any member of the Group and to obtain external
professional advice if it considers it necessary. The Committee
also reviews the interim and annual results and the annual
report and financial statements, prior to their submission to
the Board and ensures an appropriate relationship is
maintained between the Group and its external auditors.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007 21 Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Felda Hardymon
(Chairman) and John O'Connell and meets periodically as
required. The role of the Committee is to approve terms of
service, agree the remuneration of the Executive Directors
and to determine the allocation of share options within the
terms of a remuneration policy which is approved annually
by the Board.
Nominations Committee
In view of the size of the Board, the appointment of new
Directors is considered by the Board as a whole, accordingly
there is no Nominations Committee.
Shareholder communication
The Company encourages two-way communication with both
institutional and private investors and endeavours to respond
promptly to queries received. The Group's website,
www.portraitsoftware.com, provides detailed financial and
business information about the Group. It is the policy of the
Company to ensure that all our market announcements are
made immediately available to all our shareholders via the
medium of the internet.
Meetings between Directors, designated senior management,
institutional shareholders and other market professionals are
held regularly in accordance with the Company's investor
management programme and always follow the terms of the
Company's Market Communications Policy.
Shareholders attending the AGM are invited to ask questions
during the meeting and to meet the Directors and other
members of senior management after the formal proceedings
have ended.
Internal controls
The Board attaches considerable importance to the Group's
systems of internal control and risk management with specific
emphasis in the areas of financial, legal/commercial and
compliance risk.
These procedures include financial, operational and
compliance controls as well as risk management, which
accord with the criteria contained in the Internal Control
Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code published by
the ICAEW in September 1999.
The Board is responsible for the Group's system of internal
control and for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a system is
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure
to achieve business objectives and can only provide
reasonable assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board delegates day to day responsibility for internal
control and risk issues to the Chief Executive Officer who
conducts meetings with his senior management team on a
regular basis. In these management meetings the exposures
to financial, operational and compliance risks are identified,
reported on, assessed and controlled.
Corporate Governance Statement
For the year ended 31 March 2007
Portrait Software plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 22 The Audit Committee is also responsible for reviewing the
ongoing financial and compliance control procedures. The
Board reviews the effectiveness of the systems of internal
control and risk management on a continuing basis by:
  Considering Group strategy and approving an annual budget
based on that strategy and medium-term projections. Core
to this process is the review of the risks and opportunities
facing the Group undertaken on a continuing basis.
  Regularly reviewing operational performance and
updated forecasts.
  Retaining primary responsibility for acquisition and
divestment policy, the approval of major capital expenditure
and financing arrangements. Below Board level there are
clearly defined management authority limitations for the
approval of capital expenditure, Human Resource actions,
significant contracts, investments, acquisitions and
divestments.
  Receiving reports on environmental, social, ethical
and health and safety matters as they relate to the
Group's operations.
  Receiving regular reports from the Audit Committee as to
whether the systems of internal control and risk management
are operating effectively.
These procedures have been in place since the start of the
accounting period, have been reviewed and improved to
enhance their effectiveness during the year, and have remained
in place up to the date of approval of the annual report.
The Board acknowledges that companies without an internal
audit function should, from time to time, review the need to
establish one. At present the Board and the Audit Committee
feel that current internal controls are adequate to meet the
needs of the business and, while constantly reviewing
controls in all areas, will consider the need for an internal
audit function as the Group continues to develop.
Business and environmental ethics
The Board requires that its employees comply with the laws
and standards of conduct of the countries in which it does
business. The Directors and employees are all required to
avoid personal conflicts of interest regarding Company
business.
In complying with the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 in
the United Kingdom, the Group has established a procedure
enabling employees to bring matters to the attention of an
appropriate manager outside of their own department in the
event that they do not feel able to approach their local line
management.
The Board recognises that it is important, both for its
employees and the communities in which it operates, that
the Group maintains high standards of health and safety and
takes effective measures to ensure that its activities do not
damage the environment.
In particular the Group recognises the responsibility it has
toward the environment. The Group Environmental Policy
addresses compliance with environmental legislation,
conformity with standards for air, waste disposal and noise,
the economical use of materials and the establishment of
environmental performance standards. The Group
commenced implementation of this policy during 2003,
a process that has continued in 2007.
Going concern basis
After making enquiries, the Directors have formed a
judgement, at the time of approving the financial statements,
that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for
the foreseeable future. For this reason the Directors continue
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial
statements.
