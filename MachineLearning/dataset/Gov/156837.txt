Corporate Governance  
 
 
Statement by the Directors on compliance with the Combined Code 
 
 The Board of Directors has a strong commitment to high standards of corporate governance integrity and 
ethics. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) published the new  UK Corporate Governance Code  in June 
2010, replacing the  Combined Code on Corporate Governance , and in September 2010 the Quoted 
Company Alliance (QCA) published  Corporate Governance Guidelines for Smaller Quoted Companies  
replacing previous guidelines issued in 2004 and 2005. Although as an AIM listed company it is not formally 
required to do so, the Group and has followed the principles of the  UK Corporate governance Code  so far as 
is practicable and appropriate for the nature and size of the Group. The Group supports the recommendations 
on corporate governance of the QCA and has implemented steps to reach compliance. 
 
 A statement of the Directors  responsibilities in respect of the financial statements is set out on page 11. 
Below is a brief description of the role of the Board and its Committees, followed by a statement regarding 
the Group s system of internal controls. 
  
The Board and its operation 
 
The Board of Prime People Plc is the body responsible for corporate governance, establishing policies and 
objectives, and reviewing the management of the Group s resources 
 
The Board consists of an executive chairman, Robert Macdonald, two other executive Directors and two non-
executive Directors.  
 
The non-executive Directors are John Lewis and Simon Murphy. Both receive a fixed fee for their services 
and their interests in the shares of the company are as described on pages 7 and 16. 
 
Biographies of the board members appear on page 4. 
 
The Board meets up to 6 times each year and more frequently where business needs require and the Directors 
receive monthly management accounts detailing the performance of the Group.  The Board has a general 
responsibility for overseeing all day to day matters of the Company with specific responsibility for reviewing 
trading performance, resources (including key appointments), finding, setting and monitoring strategy, 
examining acquisition opportunities and reporting to shareholders.  The non-executive Directors have a 
responsibility to ensure the strategies proposed by the executive Directors are fully considered and to bring 
their judgment to bear in this role. 
 
To enable the Board to function effectively and Directors to discharge their responsibilities, full and timely 
access is given to all relevant information.  In the case of Board meetings, this consists of a comprehensive set 
of papers, including monthly business progress reports and discussion documents regarding specific matters. 
 
Directors are free to and regularly make further enquiries where they feel it is necessary and they are able to 
take independent professional advice as required at the Company's expense.  This is in addition to the access 
which every Director has to the company secretary. 
 
The Board considers itself to be a small board, and therefore has not set up a separate Nomination 
Committee.  Appointments to the Board of both executive and non-executive Directors are based on approval 
by the full Board. 
 
Any Director appointed during the year is required, under the provisions of the company's Articles of 
Association, to retire and seek reappointment by shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting.  The 
Articles also require that one-third of the Directors retire by rotation each year and seek reappointment at the 
Annual General Meeting.  13

Going concern 
 
 The Directors believe the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future.  For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts. 
 
Internal controls 
 
 The Directors are responsible for the Group s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness 
which, by its nature, can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or 
loss. 
  
 When undertaking their review the Directors have considered all material controls including operational, 
compliance and risk management, as well as financial. 
  
 The Board has assessed the effectiveness of the Group s internal control systems for the period 1 April 2010 
to the date of approval of the financial statements and believes it has the procedures in place to safeguard the 
Group s assets and to ensure the reliability of information used within the business and for publication. 
 
 Key elements of the system of internal control are as follows: 
 
 Group organisation 
 The Board of Directors meets at least six times a year focusing mainly on strategic issues, operational and 
financial performance. The Directors have in place an organisational structure with clearly defined levels of 
responsibility and delegation of authority. 
 
 Annual Business Plan 
 The Group has a comprehensive budgeting system with an annual budget approved by the Board. 
  
 Monthly forecasting 
 The Group prepares monthly fee income forecasts by individual businesses which are compared to budget. 
 
 Financial Reporting 
 Detailed monthly reports are produced showing comparison of results against budget, forecast and the prior 
year with performance monitoring and explanations provided for significant variances. Any significant 
adverse variances are examined and remedial action taken where necessary. 
 
 Capital Expenditure 
 Capital expenditure requests are reviewed by the Board. Appropriate due diligence work will be carried out if 
a business is to be acquired. 
 
 Risk Management 
 The Directors and operating company management have a clear responsibility for identifying risks facing 
each of the businesses and for putting in place procedures to mitigate and monitor risks. Risks are assessed 
during the annual budget process, which is monitored by the Board, and the ongoing Group strategy process.
