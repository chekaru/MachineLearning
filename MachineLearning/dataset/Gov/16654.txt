the Company's corporate governance arrangements, including a statement as to how the Company applies the principles

Company's current circumstances.  As a result, the Company has been in compliance throughout the year with the 
provisions set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code with the following exceptions:-

established, set out in writing and agreed by the Board. This is contrary to provision A.2.1;
  The Company does not have a Nomination Committee, this is contrary to provisions B2.1-B2.2;

provision B2.3;

and the City.  The Board has appointed Andrew Beaumont as a senior independent non-executive director. There have 
been no changes in the other significant commitments of the Chairman.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible to the Board for 
ensuring that Board procedures are complied with.  There is also a formal agreed procedure for Directors in the 
furtherance of their duties to take independent professional advice as necessary at the Company's expense.
Under the Company's Articles of Association, at least one third of the Directors retire from office each year.  The retiring 
Director is eligible for re-election. 
The role of Non-Executive Directors is a vital element of corporate accountability.  Due to the small size of the Board 
and because there are no full time Executive Directors, the Non-Executive Directors do carry out certain limited specific 
executive responsibilities.
Nomination 
Appointment to Executive Director would be fully discussed by the Chairman and the two Non-Executive Directors.  
Potential new Non-Executive Directors are proposed by all the members of the Board in the light of the Company's 
business requirements and the need to have a balanced Board.  Possible candidates are discussed amongst all Directors 
before any approach is made to them.

annual and consolidated accounts; and to review and monitor the independence of the statutory auditor and provision of 
additional services to the Group.

remuneration committee is to meet at least twice a year and has as its remit the determination and review of, amongst 
others, the remuneration of executive directors and any share incentive plans adopted, or be adopted, by the Company.
Communication with Shareholders

Group responds throughout the year to correspondence from shareholders on a wide variety of issues.

with the half yearly announcement. The Chairman is available to shareholders at any time to discuss strategy and 
governance matters.
The Board seeks to ensure that its report and accounts and other financial statements provide a clear assessment of the 
Group's business.  All shareholders have the opportunity to ask questions and express their views at the Company's 
Annual General Meeting, at which all Directors are available to take questions.  42

AUDIT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
The directors are responsible for the Group's system of internal control and reviewing its effectiveness.  These controls 
can only ever provide reasonable but not absolute assurance that assets are safeguarded against material misstatement or 
loss, that proper accounting records are maintained, and that the information used internally, or for publication, is 
accurate and reliable.  The key procedures, which exist to provide external control, are as follows -
  clearly defined organisation structures with segregation of duties wherever practicable.  Operating and financial 
responsibilities for the subsidiary Company are delegated to the subsidiary's Board and there are limits which 
apply to capital expenditure and significant contracts
  a regular review is undertaken to assess the risks facing the trading subsidiary and to enhance the systems which 
manage the risk identified.  Local management establishes control procedures for each of the risks identified and 
reports whether the key controls have operated effectively
  agreement of Group short term financial objectives and business plans
  review by the Board of monthly Group Financial Statements and monitoring of results against budget.  The 
Board attends regular Board meetings of the subsidiary
  Board control over treasury, taxation, legal, insurance and personnel issues
  The acquisition or disposal of a business may not be completed without the approval of the Board. 
  The operational responsibility for preparing the consolidated accounts is delegated to a third party service 
provider with the Board retaining responsibility for overall content, presentation and final review of the 
consolidated accounts.
Through these mechanisms, Group performance is continually monitored, risks identified in a timely manner, their 
financial implication assessed, control procedure re-evaluated and corrective actions agreed and implemented.
The Board believes that it is not currently appropriate for the Company to maintain an internal audit function due to the 
size of the Group.
The Board consider the independence and objectivity of the external auditor on an annual basis, with particular regard to 
non-audit services.  The split between audit and non-audit fees for the year and information on the nature of the non-audit 
fees appear in note 3 to the financial statements.  There were no non-audit fees incurred from the auditor during the year. 
The Board also receive an annual confirmation of independence from the auditors.
GOING CONCERN
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. There have been no changes to accounting policies 
in the year.  The most notable accounting event has been the decrease in the pension scheme deficit based on this year's 
actuarial forecast and mentioned in the Chairman's Statement. The Directors have agreed a revised schedule of the 
contributions to eliminate the deficit on the ABE Pension Fund over thirteen years starting from the year ended 31 March 
2010. Based on the Group's budgets and cash forecasts, the board considers that the Group has sufficient resources to meet 
all necessary outgoings and to enable it to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
