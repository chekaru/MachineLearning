 Statement of compliance with the Combined Code
The Company has complied throughout the year ended 31 
December 2010 with the Code provisions set out in section 1 
of the 2008 FRC Combined Code.
The Board of Directors is committed to the highest standards 
of corporate governance and has applied the principles set 
out in section 1 of the Code, including both the Main Principles 
and the supporting principles, by complying with the Code as 
reported above. Further explanation of how the Main Principles 
have been applied is set out below and, in connection with 
Directors' remuneration, in the Report of the Remuneration 
Committee and the Report of the Audit Committee.
The Group's approach to corporate governance
The Group has a policy of seeking to comply with established 
best practice in the field of corporate governance. In addition, 
one of the core values communicated within the Group is 
a belief that the highest standard of integrity is essential 
in business. The Group has an express aim of respecting 
the needs of shareholders, employees, clients, candidates, 
contractors and suppliers.
Board effectiveness
The Board is responsible to the Group's shareholders for the 
conduct and performance of the Group's business. Having 
strong governance processes and oversight help drive the 
culture of the business so that it can better deliver on its 
responsibility to all of its stakeholders. 
The Board has developed a Board governance framework 
which sets out the governance structure of the Board and 
its committees. The Board considers that is has shown its 
commitment to leading and controlling the Group by:
  having a Board constitution which details the Board's 
responsibility to the Group's shareholders for the 
management of the Group's affairs. It exercises direction 
and supervision of the Group's operations throughout the 
world and defines the line of responsibility from the Board 
to the Chief Executive and the Executive Directors in whom 
responsibility for the executive management of the business 
is vested;
   the Board retaining specific responsibility for agreeing the 
strategic direction of the Group, the approval of accounts, 
business plan, budget and capital expenditure, the review of 
operating results, the effectiveness of governance practice 
and risk management, and also the appointment of senior 
executives and succession planning;
   a high level of attendance by the Directors at the seven Board 
meetings held during the year. There were two apologies 
from Lady Judge and one apology from Giles Daubeney;
   the provision of appropriate training to all new Directors at 
the time of appointment to the Board, and by ensuring that 
existing Directors receive such training as to be equipped 
with the skills required to fulfil their roles; and
   delegating responsibilities to sub-committees as appropriate: 
Audit Committee; Remuneration Committee; and Nomination 
Committee.
Division of responsibilities between Chairman and  
Chief Executive
The Board has shown its commitment to dividing responsibilities 
for the Board and running the Company's business by:
   appointing Philip Aiken as Non-executive Chairman;
   appointing Robert Walters as Chief Executive; and
   clearly defining in writing the respective responsibilities of the 
Chairman and the Chief Executive.
Board balance
The Group's commitment to achieving a balance of Executive 
and Non-executive Directors is shown by:
   the Non-executive Directors comprising more than half of the 
Board of Directors;
   the Non-executive Directors being considered to act 
independently of management and free from any business 
relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of 
their independent judgement; and
   Martin Griffiths, Lady Judge and Andrew Kemp being 
considered to be free from any other relationship which could 
materially interfere with the exercise of their independent 
judgement.
Russell Tenzer has been a Non-executive Director of the 
Robert Walters Group since 1989 and Philip Aiken has been a 
Non-executive Director of the Company since July 2000. As a 
result, the Board considers that Russell and Philip do have a 
long-standing relationship with two of the Executive Directors.
The Board has formally considered these relationships and 
has concluded after a specific review of their conduct that 
the exercise of their independent judgement since their 
appointment to the Board of Robert Walters plc in July 
2000 has not been affected. In particular, Russell Tenzer is a 
Senior practicing audit partner at Hazlems Fenton, Chartered 
Accountants, and adds significant rigour to the Board and 
Audit Committee due to his detailed understanding of the 
business and his application of objective professional challenge 
and scepticism to all relevant matters. Philip Aiken has 
successfully fulfilled a key role as Chairman of the Board since 
2007 and is able to bring to the Board's deliberations a wealth 
of relevant business, financial and international experience.
As Philip Aiken and Russell Tenzer have now been Directors of 
the Company for over nine years, they are subject to re-election 
on an annual basis. Consequently, they will both retire at the 
Annual General Meeting and offer themselves for re-election.
Transparency of Board appointments
The Nomination Committee is responsible for nominating 
candidates to fill Board vacancies and considers the ongoing 
succession of the Board and its Committees, making 
recommendations on Board composition and balance. The 
members of the Committee, which met once during the 
year, are the Non-executive Directors and Robert Walters. 
During the year, the Nomination Committee met to consider 
and approve the re-election at the AGM of Philip Aiken, Lady 
Judge, Andrew Kemp and Russell Tenzer.

Robert Walters plc
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 
2010 The Nomination Committee has written terms of reference 
which are available on request. The procedure for 
appointments to the Board includes the requirement to 
specify the nature of the position in writing and to ensure that 
appointees have sufficient time available to meet the demands 
of the position. The terms of the contracts for the Non-
executive Directors are available upon request. 
Regular re-election of Directors 
As disclosed in the Directors' Report, all Directors are subject 
to re-election every three years, or every year in the case 
of those Non-executive Directors who have held office for 
more than nine years, as required by the provisions of the 
Code of Best Practice. Prior to renomination, the Nomination 
Committee will conduct an assessment of the performance 
of each retiring Director. The Board will not approve such a 
re-nomination if the performance of the retiring Director is not 
considered satisfactory.
Timeliness and quality of Board information
The Board has sought to ensure that Directors are properly 
briefed on issues arising at Board meetings by establishing 
procedures for:
   distributing Board papers in advance of meetings and 
considering the adequacy of the information provided before 
making decisions;
   adjourning meetings or deferring decisions when Directors 
have concerns about the information available to them; and
   making the Company Secretary responsible to the Board 
for the timeliness and quality of information.
Performance evaluation
The annual performance appraisal of the Board and its 
Committees is considered by the Board to meet the 
requirements of the Combined Code. A detailed review was 
completed by each Director and individual discussions took 
place between the Chairman and each of the Directors and, 
in the case of the Chairman, with the Senior Independent 
Non-executive Director. Subsequently, there was a full Board 
discussion of the matters that were raised and a process 
to ensure that the decisions taken were appropriately 
implemented. This process did not identify any material issues 
that needed to be addressed.
Dialogue with institutional shareholders
The Directors seek to build on a mutual understanding 
of objectives between the Company and its institutional 
shareholders by:
   making annual and interim presentations to institutional 
investors;
   meeting shareholders to discuss long-term issues and obtain 
their views; and
   communicating regularly throughout the year; and regular 
meetings of the Board being used as the forum to ensure 
that Non-executive Directors are updated on the views of 
major shareholders that have been communicated to the 
Executive Directors.
Senior Independent Director
The Board has appointed Lady Judge as the Senior 
Independent Director. Lady Judge is available to shareholders 
who have concerns that cannot be addressed through the 
Chief Executive.
Constructive use of Annual General Meeting
The Board seeks to use the Annual General Meeting to 
communicate with private investors and encourage their 
participation by:
   inviting shareholders to submit questions in advance; and
   providing a balanced and understandable assessment of the 
Group's position and prospects.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the effectiveness of the Group's 
system of internal control. A review has been completed by 
the Board for the year ended 31 December 2010 and up to the 
date of approval of the Annual Report, in accordance with the 
recommendations of the Turnbull Report. 
The Board's monitoring covers all controls, including financial, 
operational and compliance controls and risk management. 
It is based primarily on reviewing reports from management 
to consider whether significant risks are identified, evaluated, 
managed and controlled and whether any significant 
weaknesses are promptly remedied and indicate a need for 
more extensive monitoring. The Audit Committee assists the 
Board in discharging its review responsibilities. 
During the course of its review of the system of internal control, 
the Board has not identified nor been advised of any failings 
or weaknesses which it has determined to be significant. 
Therefore, a confirmation in respect of necessary actions has 
been considered appropriate.
The Group's system of internal control is designed to  
safeguard the Group's assets and to ensure the reliability of 
information used within the business and for publication. Such 
a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the 
risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide 
only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
The full Board meets regularly and has a schedule of matters 
which are required to be brought to it or its duly authorised 
Committees for decision, aimed at maintaining full and effective 
control over appropriate strategic, financial, operational and 
compliance issues on an ongoing basis.
The Board has put in place an organisational structure with 
clearly defined responsibilities and delegation of authority. The 
Board constitution clearly sets out those matters for which the 
Board is required to give its approval.
Audit Committee and Auditors
A separate Report of the Audit Committee is set out on 
page 18 and provides details of the role and activities of the 
committee and its relationship with the external auditors.
