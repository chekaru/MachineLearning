This Corporate Governance Report describes the manner in which  
the Company has applied the Principles of Good Governance set out  
in Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance and  
whether or not it has complied with the Code provisions. In July 2003,  
the Financial Reporting Council (FRC ) issued the Combined Code  
on Corporate Governance  (the FRC Code ), in response to the Higgs 
Review on non-executive directors and the Smith Review on Audit 
Committees. The FRC Code was then revised in 2006 and 2008.
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE COMBINED CODE
The Company has been in compliance with the provisions set out in 
Section 1 of the 2006 version of the FRC Code throughout the year.
APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE FRC CODE
The Principles of Good Corporate Governance are detailed in the FRC 
Code under four areas. These have each been reviewed by the Directors 
and commented upon below:
A) DIRECTORS
The Board is structured under a non-executive Chairman, and includes 
three executive Directors, and three other independent non-executive 
Directors, who were selected for appointment because of their wide 
industrial and commercial experience. In addition, there is an Executive 
Committee, chaired by the Group Chief Executive, which is comprised  
of the executive Directors and other key executives within the Group.  
Brief details of the members of the Board and of the Executive 
Committee are included on pages 6 and 7.
The Directors consider that there is in place an effective Board  
which leads and controls the Group, with clear divisions of responsibility 
between running the Board and running the Group's businesses. 
The Board is responsible for the strategic decisions regarding the Group, 
including the setting of commercial strategy and approval of Group 
budgets and financial statements. It also approves significant financial 
and contractual commitments made by the Group. The Board's Terms of 
Reference more fully describe the responsibilities of the Board, and may 
be found on the Company's website.
The Board delegates certain of its responsibilities to the Audit, Remuneration, 
Nominations, and Health, Safety & Environment (HSE ) Committees.  
The Group Chief Executive, together with the Executive Committee,  
is responsible for the implementation of the decisions made by the Board, 
and for the day-to-day conduct of the Group's operations. 
The Board meets formally on a regular basis (nine times in 2008); and in 
addition there were three meetings of the Audit Committee in 2008, together 
with five meetings of the Remuneration Committee, five meetings of the 
Nominations Committee and five meetings of the HSE Committee. There 
was full attendance at every Board meeting and Committee of the Board 
during the year. Other Committees are appointed by the Board to deal with 
treasury matters and specific issues such as acquisitions and disposals.  
The minutes arising from the Committee meetings are available to the Board.
Procedures are in place to ensure that the Directors are properly briefed  
so that the decisions taken by the Board are based on the fullest available 
information. At every Board meeting there are reviews of operational, 
financial and administrative matters. Health, safety and environmental 
performance is reviewed by the Board on a regular, and at least quarterly, 
basis; while social and ethical issues, agreement of budgets and levels  
of insurance cover are reviewed whenever appropriate.
There is a procedure by which all Directors can obtain independent 
professional advice at the Company's expense in furtherance of their 
duties, if required.
NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE
The Nominations Committee leads the process for Board appointments, 
and supervises management development and succession plans. It also 
makes recommendations to the Board on all new Board appointments. 
The Committee, which consists entirely of non-executive Directors,  
is chaired by Martin Clark, and its composition is shown on page 7.  
Its Terms of Reference may be found on the Company's website.
The appointment of new Directors to the Board is controlled by the 
Committee, assisted by appropriate external recruitment consultants.  
In conjunction with the external consultant, consideration is given to the 
role and the capabilities required for a particular appointment. Based on 
agreed criteria, the consultant then produces a shortlist of candidates. 
The Committee members interview these candidates, and then present 
their recommendation to the Board. When appointing non-executive 
Directors, consideration is also given to the number of other posts held  
by the candidates, and their ability to devote sufficient time to discharge 
their duty as a non-executive Director. Following completion of extensive 
selection processes, the Nominations Committee recommended the 
appointments of Mark Rollins as Group Chief Executive, Simon Nicholls 
as Group Finance Director, and Michael Steel as a non-executive Director.
Michael Steel has been appointed for an initial period of three years, with 
potential for renewal for a further three years, unless terminated by either 
the Company or Michael Steel upon giving one month's notice. His annual 
fee is  35,000.
During the year, the Board undertook a formal review to evaluate its own 
performance, and that of its Committees and individual Directors; this 
process involved the completion and review of performance assessment 
questionnaires, and appraisal interviews. The results of the evaluation 
process are used to improve Board performance and to determine the 
training needs of the Directors. David Best and Ian Much, in consultation  
with the executive Directors, undertook an evaluation of the Chairman's 
performance, and concluded that Martin Clark provided effective leadership 
of the Board. Based on the results of the performance evaluation process, 
the Chairman considers that each member of the Board, the Board 
collectively, and its Committees, continue to contribute effectively to  
the running of the Company.
In accordance with the Company's Articles, Directors submit themselves 
for re-election at the Annual General Meeting following their appointment 
and thereafter at intervals of no more than three years. Senior plc

B) DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
The Remuneration Report on pages 28 to 35 describes how the Board 
has applied itself to remuneration matters.
C) ACCOUNTABILITY AND AUDIT
The Audit Committee Report on pages 26 and 27 describes the role 
and activities of the Audit Committee and its relationship with the 
internal and external auditors. 
The Company has a Whistle-blowing Policy that is communicated 
throughout the Group. This policy provides employees with the 
opportunity to report unethical or illegal corporate conduct. Ian Much  
is the Company's Senior Independent Director. His position provides 
shareholders with an alternative channel of communication if they have  
a concern that the Chairman, Group Chief Executive or Group Finance 
Director have failed to resolve, or where such contact is appropriate. 
D) RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Company maintains regular contact with its institutional shareholders. 
Twice a year, the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director 
undertake a series of meetings with the Company's major shareholders, 
following the announcement of the full year and interim results, to discuss 
both strategic objectives and the detailed performance of the business. 
During 2008, the Company's non-executive Chairman also attended the 
full year and interim results announcements to shareholders and analysts, 
in March and August respectively. No other non-executive Director 
formally met with shareholders during the year. The Senior Independent 
Director is available to attend shareholder meetings, if this is requested 
by shareholders, so providing an alternative channel of communication 
between the Company and its shareholders. The Company's largest 
shareholders were invited to meet Michael Steel following his 
appointment as a non-executive Director on 1 May 2008.
The Company makes constructive use of the Annual General Meeting  
to communicate with private investors. A presentation of the Company's 
performance is given at the AGM, and a copy of the presentation, along  
with other investor relations material, is available on the Company's website.
All resolutions put to shareholders at the AGM 2008 were passed 
unanimously on a show of hands. Resolution 12 (relating to the inclusion 
of a dispute resolution provision in the revised Articles of Association) 
was withdrawn and not put to the meeting. Details of the proxy  
voting received by the Company for the AGM 2008 are set out in  
the table below.
The issued share capital as at 29 February 2008 (the date of the  
Notice of the AGM 2008), was 391.0 million shares of 10p each.
The total number of proxy votes received for the AGM 2008 represented 
approximately 57.8% (2007 - 68.1%) of the issued share capital of the 
Company. The Company is supportive of initiatives to promote greater 
shareholder participation and offers CREST members the facility to appoint  
a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service. 
Further details of this service may be found in the enclosed Notice of the 
Annual General Meeting.
