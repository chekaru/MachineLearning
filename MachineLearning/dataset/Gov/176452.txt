Corporate Governance Report
This Corporate Governance Report describes the manner in which 
the Company has applied the Principles of Good Governance  
set out in Section 1 of the June 2008 Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance (Combined Code ). 
Statement of Compliance with the Combined Code
The Company has been in compliance with the provisions set out  
in Section 1 of the Combined Code throughout the year.
Application of the Principles of the Combined Code
The Principles of Good Corporate Governance are detailed in the 
Combined Code under four areas. These have each been reviewed 
by the Directors and are commented upon below:
a) Directors
The Board is structured under a non-executive Chairman,  
and includes two executive Directors, and three independent 
non-executive Directors, who were selected for appointment 
because of their wide industrial and commercial experience. In 
addition, there is an Executive Committee, chaired by the Group 
Chief Executive, comprising the executive Directors and other key 
executives within the Group. Brief details of the Board and of the 
key Executive Committee members are included on page 31.
The Directors consider that there is in place an effective Board 
which leads and controls the Group, with clear divisions of 
responsibility between the running of the Board and the running  
of the Group's businesses. 
The Board is responsible for strategic decisions affecting the Group, 
including the setting of commercial strategy and the approval of 
Group budgets and financial statements. It also approves significant 
financial and contractual commitments made by the Group. The 
Board's Terms of Reference more fully describe the responsibilities 
of the Board, and may be found on the Company's website.
The Board delegates certain of its responsibilities to the Audit, 
Remuneration, Nominations, and Health, Safety & Environment 
(HSE ) Committees. The Group Chief Executive, together with  
the Executive Committee, is responsible for the implementation  
of the decisions made by the Board, and for the day-to-day conduct 
of the Group's operations. 
The Board meets formally on a regular basis (nine times in 2010); in 
addition there were three meetings of the Audit Committee in 2010, 
together with six meetings of the Remuneration Committee, one 
meeting of the Nominations Committee and four meetings of the 
HSE Committee. There was full attendance at every Board meeting 
and Committee of the Board during the year with the exception 
noted on page 31. Other committees are appointed by the Board to 
deal with treasury matters and specific issues such as acquisitions 
and disposals. The minutes arising from all Committee meetings  
are available to the Board.
Procedures are in place to ensure that the Directors are properly 
briefed, so that decisions taken by the Board are based on the 
fullest available information. At every Board meeting there are 
reviews of operational, financial and administrative matters. Group 
strategy, and health, safety and environmental performance are 
reviewed by the Board on a regular basis. Social and ethical issues, 
the agreement of budgets and levels of insurance cover are 
reviewed whenever appropriate.
There is a procedure by which all Directors can obtain independent 
professional advice at the Company's expense in furtherance of 
their duties, if required.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee leads the process for Board 
appointments, and supervises management development and 
succession planning. It also makes recommendations to the  
Board on all new Board appointments and re-appointments. The 
Committee, which consists entirely of non-executive Directors, is 
chaired by Martin Clark, and its composition is shown on page 31. 
Its Terms of Reference may be found on the Company's website.
The appointment of new Directors to the Board is controlled by  
the Committee, assisted by an appropriate external recruitment 
consultant. In conjunction with the external consultant, 
consideration is given to the role and the capabilities required for  
a particular appointment. Based on agreed criteria, the consultant 
then produces a shortlist of candidates. Members of the Committee 
interview the shortlisted candidates, and then present their 
recommendation to the Board. When appointing non-executive 
Directors, consideration is also given to the number of other posts 
held by the candidates, and their ability to devote sufficient time to 
discharge their duties as a non-executive Director. 
During the year, the Board undertook a formal review to evaluate  
its own performance, and that of its Committees and individual 
Directors; this process involved the completion and review of 
performance assessment questionnaires and appraisal interviews. 
The results of the evaluation process are used to improve Board 
performance and to determine the training needs of the Directors. 
Ian Much, in consultation with the Directors, undertook an 
evaluation of the Chairman's performance, and concluded that 
Martin Clark provided effective leadership of the Board. Based on 
the results of the performance evaluation process, the Chairman 
considers that all members of the Board, the Board collectively,  
and its Committees, continue to contribute effectively to the running 
of the Company.
There were no new appointments to the Board in 2010. Michael 
Steel has indicated that he wishes to retire from the Board at the 
Annual General Meeting 2011 and the Nominations Committee  
has commenced the process to appoint two new non-executive 
Directors. The Board is to adopt the New Code's provision relating 
to the annual re-election of Directors for the Annual General 
Meeting 2011 and David Best, Martin Clark, Simon Nicholls,  
Ian Much and Mark Rollins will all stand for re-election at  
the AGM.  Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 35

b) Directors' remuneration
The Remuneration Report on pages 38 to 45 describes the Board's 
approach to remuneration matters.
c) Accountability and audit
The Audit Committee Report on pages 36 and 37 describes the role 
and activities of the Audit Committee and its relationship with the 
internal and external auditor. 
The Company has a whistle-blowing policy that is communicated 
throughout the Group. This policy provides employees with  
the opportunity to report unethical or illegal corporate conduct.  
Ian Much is the Company's Senior Independent Director. His 
position provides employees with an alternative channel of 
communication to resolve issues if they have a concern that the 
Chairman, Group Chief Executive or Group Finance Director have 
failed to resolve these, or where such contact with them is not 
appropriate. The Group's ethical procedures and Code of Business 
Conduct have been reviewed in light of the potential impact of  
the Bribery Act 2010 and enhancements planned as appropriate.
d) Relations with shareholders
The Company maintains regular contact with its institutional 
shareholders. At least twice a year, the Group Chief Executive  
and Group Finance Director undertake a series of meetings with  
the Company's major shareholders, following the announcement  
of the preliminary full-year and interim results, to discuss both 
strategic objectives and the detailed performance of the business. 
During 2010, the Company's non-executive Chairman also attended 
the preliminary full-year and interim results announcement 
presentations to analysts, in March and August respectively. No 
shareholders requested a meeting with any non-executive Directors 
during the year. The Senior Independent Director is available to 
attend shareholder meetings, if this is requested by shareholders, 
so providing an alternative channel of communication between the 
Company and its shareholders.
The Company makes constructive use of its Annual General 
Meeting to communicate with private investors. A presentation  
of the Company's performance is given at the AGM, and a copy  
of the presentation, along with other investor relations material,  
is available on the Company's website.
All resolutions put to shareholders at the AGM 2010 were passed 
on a show of hands. Details of the proxy voting received by the 
Company for the AGM 2010 resolutions are set out in the table 
below. The total number of proxy votes received for the AGM 2010 
represented approximately 66.8% (2009 - 66.2%) of the issued 
share capital of the Company.
The Company is supportive of initiatives to promote greater 
shareholder participation and offers CREST members the facility  
to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy 
appointment service. Further details of this service may be found  
in the proxy form.
