This section describes in broad terms how

overall structure and principal roles and 
responsibilities of the Board, its committees 
and other significant bodies such as the 
Senior Executive Team (SET) and the R&D 
Executive Committee.
ASTRAZENECA plC Bo ARd CompoSITIoN, 
pRoCESSES ANd RESpoNSIBIlITIES
The Board comprises three Executive Directors 
(two from April 2009 when John Patterson's 
retirement takes effect) and 11 Non-Executive 
Directors. The membership of the Board at 
31 December 2008, and information about 
individual Directors is contained in the Board 
of Directors section on pages 84 and 85.
All Directors are collectively responsible for the 
success of the Company. The Non-Executive 
Directors have a responsibility to bring 
independent, objective judgement to bear on 
Board decisions, which includes constructively 
challenging management and helping to 
develop the Company's strategy as well as 
scrutinising the performance of management. 
The Non-Executive Directors also have 
various responsibilities concerning the integrity 
of financial information, internal controls and 
risk management. 
At the end of every Board meeting, the 
Company's Non-Executive Directors meet 
without the Executive Directors present in 
order to review and discuss any matters that 
have arisen during the meeting and/or such 
other matters as may appear to the Non-
Executive Directors to be relevant to them in 
properly discharging their duties independently. 
To ensure the Board has good visibility of the 
key operating decisions of the business, 
members of the SET routinely attend Board 
meetings on a rotational basis and the Board 
regularly meets and consults other senior 
employees throughout the year.
