The maintenance of effective corporate 
governance remains a key priority 
for the Board. The Board recognises 
the importance of sound corporate 
governance and has adopted policies 
and procedures which reflect the 
principles of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code that are consistent 
with the Corporate Governance 
Guidelines for Smaller Quoted 
Companies published by the Quoted 
Companies Alliance in September 2010, 
of which the Company is a member.
THE BOARD
The Board comprises two Executive 
Directors and six Non-Executive 
Directors providing an appropriate 
balance of executive and non-executive 
positions on the Board. The directors 
have a broad range of relevant strategic, 
industry, financial, governance and other 
experience to enable the Company 
to fulfil its objective of becoming one 
of the world's most important potash 
producers. The particular experience 
and skills of each director can be found 
in their biographies on pages 40 to 42.
A clear separation is maintained 
between the responsibilities of the 
Chairman and the Managing Director 
and CEO. The Chairman is responsible 
for leading the Board and the Managing 
Director and CEO is responsible for the 
overall performance of the Company.
The Chairman, Russell Scrimshaw is 
non-executive. The Deputy Chairman, 
Chris Catlow is also non-executive.  
The executive directors are Chris Fraser, 
the Managing Director and CEO and 
Jason Murray, the Finance Director  
and CFO. The remaining four  
Non-Executive Directors are Michael 
Mainelli, Peter Woods, Lord Hutton  
and Sir David Higgins. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
The Board considers Russell 
Scrimshaw, Michael Mainelli, Lord 
Hutton and Sir David Higgins to 
be independent in character and 
independent in judgement and are 
therefore independent directors. 
Although not all of these directors fully 
satisfy the guidelines set out in the 
UK Corporate Governance Code the 
Board has considered the situation of 
each director and the relevance of the 
differences with the guidelines in the 
context of the Company being listed 
on AIM and has concluded on each 
directors' independence.
If a potential conflict of interest exists 
or arises for any director he is required 
to declare such conflicts, which will be 
recorded, and the Board will exercise 
its authority under the Company's 
Articles of Association as appropriate in 
considering such conflict.
The Board meets regularly during the 
year, at least every two months, to 
discuss significant matters including 
long term strategy, short-term 
operational activities and financial 
performance. The latest management 
reports and accounts, including 
variances to budget, are presented at 
each Board meeting.
The Company's Articles of Association 
require one third of the directors to retire 
from office by rotation at every Annual 
General Meeting. Due to the recent 
election of several directors, only Chris 
Catlow will be retiring by rotation at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
For the duration of the year the 
Company had an Audit Committee 
and a Remuneration & Nominations 
Committee, but subsequent to the year 
end the Remuneration and Nominations 
Committee was separated into two 
committees a Remuneration Committee 
and a Nominations Committee.  
All of the committees have formally 
delegated responsibilities by way of 
terms of reference.
AUDIT COMMITTEE
The members of the Audit Committee 
are Chris Catlow, Michael Mainelli 
and Sir David Higgins. Chris Catlow 
is Chairman of the committee. The 
committee consists entirely of Non-
Executive Directors and Michael 
Mainelli and Sir David Higgins are 
deemed to be independent. The duties 
of the committee include reviewing 
the Company and Group financial 
statements, reviewing the effectiveness 
of the Company's internal controls 
and risk management systems and 
overseeing the relationship with the 
external auditor. The committee 
meets at least three times a year. The 
executive directors attend meetings by 
invitation.
REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
The members of the Remuneration 
Committee are Lord Hutton, Russell 
Scrimshaw and Chris Catlow. Lord 
Hutton is Chairman of the committee. 
The committee consists entirely of  
Non-Executive Directors and Lord 
Hutton is deemed to be independent. 
The duties of the committee include 
reviewing the remuneration and service 
contracts of executive directors and 
reviewing the design of all share 
incentive plans. The committee 
meets at least once a year. Directors' 
remuneration for the year is given in 
note 7 to the consolidated accounts and 
this disclosure forms part of this report.
NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE
The members of the Nominations 
Committee are Michael Mainelli and 
Russell Scrimshaw. Michael Mainelli 
is Chairman of the committee. The 
committee consists entirely of Non-
Executive Directors and Michael 
Mainelli is deemed to be independent. 
The duties of the committee include 
evaluating the balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience on the 
Board before any appointments are 
made. The committee meets at least 
once a year.  SIRIUS MINERALS PLC > ANNUAL REPORT 2012 > GOVERNANCE > CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT

The performance of the Board, 
committees and individual directors 
are evaluated on a regular basis. 
Individual director evaluation includes 
whether each director continues to 
contribute effectively and demonstrates 
commitment to their role by attending 
Board meetings. 
Further ad hoc meetings were held 
during the year to approve certain 
matters during the period leading to the 
placing and on other matters.
INTERNAL CONTROLS
The Board has overall responsibility for 
the effectiveness of the Group's internal 
controls in safeguarding the assets of 
the Group. The internal control systems 
are designed to identify and manage 
risks to ensure that the possibilities of 
material misstatements or loss are kept 
to a minimum.
The processes used by the Board 
to review the effectiveness of the 
internal controls are through the 
Audit Committee and the executive 
management reporting to the Board on 
a regular basis where business plans, 
budgets and authorisation limits for 
the approval of significant expenditure 
including investment are appraised and 
agreed. The Board also seeks to ensure 
that there is a proper organisational 
and management structure with clear 
responsibilities and accountability.
The Company has adopted and applies 
a share dealing code on the dealing in 
securities of the Company by directors 
and employees, to ensure compliance 
with Rule 21 of the AIM Rules.
The Company has undertaken a 
risk assessment to determine the 
Company's exposure to bribery and 
corruption risk in the countries, sectors 
and markets in which it operates. 
Following this assessment the Board 
considered that the Company's risk 
exposure in these areas was low, but 
implemented certain policies and 
procedures to ensure compliance with 
the requirements of the Bribery Act 2010 
and that the Company's employees 
were suitably briefed on these policies 
and procedures. The Company will 
continue to monitor risk regularly and to 
determine the adequacy of the briefing 
of employees to ensure compliance.
Due to the small size of the Group, 
an internal audit function has not 
been established. The Board receives 
sufficient assurance on risk, control 
and governance from other assurance 
activities within the Group including 
from regular management information 
and the external auditors.
