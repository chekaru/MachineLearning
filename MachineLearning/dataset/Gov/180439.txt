Results overview
The nancial results for the year show a net 
pro t before tax of  80k compared to a loss of 
 250k in the previous year which represents a 
signi cant improvement in trading in the year.
The  80k net pro t is stated after  76k of 
exceptional costs relating to the acquisition 
of Count on Us, so a more appropriate year 
on year comparison is at the operating pro t 
level which produced a pro t of  20 k in this 
 nancial year compared to a loss of  212k 
in the prior year, representing a  415k 
improvement in pro tability in the year.
The primary driver behind the improvement 
in performance is that revenues increased by 
 1,022k in the year. This was achieved with 
only a 0.2 drop in gross margin from the prior 
year, which generated an additional   67k of 
gross pro t. Overheads including head of ce 
costs also decreased by  48k in the year. 
This is largely due to the savings achieved on 
Non- xecutive Director fees, as they waived 
their fees last year when trading conditions 
were particularly dif cult.
The operating pro t for the second half of the 
year was   9k (2011:  71k). The operating pro t 
stated in the interim statement for the rst six 
months' trading was  164k (2011:  28 k loss).
The DfT contract has impacted the seasonality 
of the business as 72 of this contract is 
performed in the rst six months of the nancial 
year. In addition the second six months' trading 
incorporates December and January where 
the performance is seasonally low as it is 
impacted by holidays and poor weather when 
clients generally do not want to conduct 
traf c surveys as it produces inconsistent 
non-normalised data.
The reduction in operating pro t for the 
second half of this nancial year compared 
to last nancial year is due to an increase 
in operating costs in the period compared 
to the prior year which is commented on 
in more detail below.
As the Count on Us acquisition completed 
on 16 March 2012 there is no material impact 
on the operating trading performance. More 
detail on the accounting for the acquisition 
is covered below. 
All the business segments showed improved 
operating pro t performance in the year. 
The UK Traf c business produced an 
operating pro t of  189k (2011:  26k loss), 
Australia Traf c  151k (2011:  7 k) and 
Data Capture a loss of  1 k (2011:  52k loss).
Head of ce costs before exceptional costs 
were  8 k less than last nancial year at  124k.
Interest charges incurred primarily relate 
to the interest on hire purchase contracts 
for the operational vehicles for surveyors.
Revenue
Group revenue for the year was  5,779k 
(2011:  4,757k) which represents an increase 
of 22 in the year. The turnover gure for 
this year is the highest in the Group's history. 
Revenues were up on the prior year in all 
three businesses. 
UK Traf c revenue increased to   , 22k 
(2011:  2,751k), an increase of 21 , whilst 
revenue in Data Capture increased by 8 
to  4 4k (2011:  401k). In Australia Traf c 
the revenue increased by  418k of which 
 9 k relates to foreign currency uctuation 
between the UK Pound and the Australian 
Dollar. The underlying revenue shows a year 
on year increase of 20 . The average 
exchange rate for this nancial year is 
AUS 1.54 compared to AUS 1.6 in the 
last nancial year.
The UK Traf c revenue increase re ects the 
impact of the rst full year of DfT National 
Census contract which mitigated the impact 
of a more dif cult underlying core market due 
to the general slowdown in the UK economy. 
The Australia Traf c revenue increase results 
from a combination of factors which include 
the buoyant nature of the Australian economy 
at present and the business winning a number 
of larger projects than it has done historically 
re ecting the continued development of 
Australia Traf c into a market leading position.
Gross margin
Group gross margin for the year was in line 
with management's expectations and the 
prior year at 6.9 (2011: 7.1 ).

Financial statements
Business review
Corporate governance
The UK Traf c business saw a decline in 
gross margin to 1.1 from a previous year 
 gure of 4.4 . This decrease in margin 
is due to reversals of some of the previous 
operating cost reductions. The wage-related 
costs in the business were reduced in the 
second half of the previous nancial year; 
some of these reductions were permanent 
but some were temporary as they involved 
staff taking salary reductions or working 
reduced hours. These measures were put 
in place to better align the cost base of the 
business to the revenue whilst maintaining a 
core of operational resource so the business 
could respond as and when the revenue levels 
picked up. These temporary cost measures 
were partially reversed during the year which 
has resulted in a decrease of gross pro t 
from the levels achieved during the second 
half of last year when the maximum bene t of 
the cost savings was re ected in the results.
Gross margin in Data Capture has improved 
in the year to 7. (2011: 1.1 ) due to a 
reduction of staff and changing some working 
practices so production was more exible and 
could be changed in line with business needs.
Gross pro t in Australia Traf c increased by 
 .2 in the year to 46.9 (2011: 4 .7 ) as 
a result of cost reductions in the last nancial 
year and by outsourcing the data analysis 
to Korea.
Overheads and other costs
Other administrative expenses include the 
operating overheads and head of ce costs of 
 1,929k (2011:  1,977k). The reduction was 
primarily due to a saving on Non-Executive 
Director fees commented on above.
The exceptional costs of  76k are professional 
charges relating to the acquisition of COU.
Tax
The tax charge in the year of  49k relates 
to tax charges on Australia Traf c's pro ts 
(2011:  9k). There is no current year tax charge 
in the UK as the business has generated 
further tax losses to add to those brought 
forward from previous years. Last year's tax 
charge included the release of a  61k provision 
for UK deferred tax that was no longer required.
Balance sheet
Net assets as at 1 March 2012 were  2, 86k 
(2011:  1,55 k). 
Non-current assets have increased by  548k 
in the year and of this increase  454k relates 
to the acquisition of Count on Us.
After conducting a fair value review of the assets 
acquired as at the acquisition date,  296k 
has been accounted for as property, plant 
and equipment, which includes  186k of 
operational survey equipment.  159k has been 
recognised as an intangible asset relating to 
the customer relationships acquired. 
The goodwill of  7 0k represents historic 
goodwill and there were no additions to this 
as part of the acquisition of Count on Us.
 99k of the goodwill balance relates to 
Data Capture. In the Directors' view there has 
been no impairment of this goodwill despite 
the fact that Data Capture has reported 
losses in the last two years.
The losses in the last two years have been 
due to strategic decisions to attempt to grow 
the business. The Board made a decision 
to invest in its sales and marketing resource 
to grow the business. As commented on in 
previous annual reports and announcements, 
this has been more dif cult to do than we 
anticipated. In reaching their assessment that 
there has been no impairment, the Directors 
have looked at the underlying pro t after 
adjusting for the extra business development 
costs. This adjusted pro t is in line with 
the historic pro ts that were acquired. 
The Directors are con dent that the business 
will return to pro tability next year as the 
business development cost has been reduced 
to re ect the dif culty in winning work. 
The Directors remain con dent that the more 
focussed business development that remains 
will generate enough new business to cover 
its cost.
Other signi cant additions to assets include 
 1 2k on motor vehicles which included 
replacing part of the operating eet and 
 178k was invested on new operational assets.

Cash ow
The Group generated   11k (2011:  190k) 
net cash from operating activities, the 
increase re ecting the improved operating 
pro t of the business.
The majority of the increase from receivables 
of  405k is due to the invoicing arrangements 
related to the Count on Us acquisition, when 
an additional  178k was invoiced at the end 
of March. In general, debtors are managed 
effectively with the majority of cash collected 
within 60 days, although the calculation of 
debtors' days is 65 days. If adjusted for the 
Count on Us impact it would only be 56 days 
(2011: 55 days).
The Group issued shares to the value of 
 808k in connection with the acquisition of 
Count on Us. Of this amount,  455k related 
to consideration for the business and   5 k 
(net of expenses) was raised in cash to provide 
increased working capital to fund the deal 
costs and the integration of the business.
A  75k three year loan was secured with 
Royal Bank of Scotland Group which provided 
additional working capital headroom.
In addition to the funds raised above, 
the UK business is nanced through an 
invoice discounting facility which has helped 
the business grow during the last few years 
of economic uncertainty. Australia Traf c 
has their own banking arrangements which 
includes an overdraft facility of AUS$125k.
The purchase of plant and equipment of 
 620k includes  296k for the purchase of 
the Count on Us tangible assets. Excluding 
these additions,  178k was invested in 
operational survey equipment in both the UK 
and Australia including  60k of Bluetooth 
recording equipment in the UK and  98k of 
automatic traf c counters in Australia which 
will help generate future growth.
The Group generated an increase in cash and 
cash equivalents of  157k which resulted in a 
net cash balance of  105k. Net debt reduced 
by  20k as the increase in cash was offset by 
the loan from Royal Bank of Scotland as part 
of the acquisition nance and an increase in 
hire purchase obligations due to the investment 
in the renewal of some of the operational 
vehicle eet.
