for reviewing its effectiveness. Such a 
system can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. The key 
procedures established are as follows:
  Responsibility levels, the ethos 
of the Group, the delegation 
of authority and other control 
procedures, together with 
appropriate accounting policies, 
are communicated throughout 
the Group;
  The Group appoints experienced 
and professional staff of the 
necessary calibre, both through 
promotion and recruitment, to  
fulfil their responsibilities;
  The Group maintains an annual 
budget process. The Board sets 
budgets once per year and 
monitors actual performance 
against those budgets at every 
Board meeting. The Board

takes action as appropriate;
Annual Report & Accounts 2012 Swallowfield plc 31
  The audit Committee considers 
significant control matters. 
Management letter points raised 
by the external auditors are 
discussed by the Audit Committee 
and are dealt with as appropriate;
  The group maintains an 
expenditure approval process 
that ensures that the Board 
approves major expenditure and 
investments; and
  The Board undertakes a review 
of internal controls annually. The 
Group implemented the Turnbull 
guidance during 2000 and has 
continued in compliance during 
the year under review. The 
Board has procedures in place 
for regular risk management 
reviews. These reviews focus on 
risk assessment, risk management 
and corrective actions, and are 
carried out by the main Board 
directly with senior managers 
who are actively encouraged to 
embed the process throughout 
their departments. The reviews 
are conducted annually for 
Sales, Technical, Operations, 
Environmental, Finance and 
IT matters, and twice yearly 
for Health and Safety matters. 
The whole process is reviewed 
annually together with a further 
summary assessment of the major 
risks facing the business.
The Board has considered the need 
for an internal audit function and has 
concluded that, because of the size 
of the group, it cannot be justified at 
present. The Board intend to review 
this decision each year.
