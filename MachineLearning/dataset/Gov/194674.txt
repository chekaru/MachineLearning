The Board
The Board currently comprises a non-executive chairman, a chief executive, one other executive director and two
non-executive directors. Biographies of these directors appear on page 10.
David Hewitt has held the position of non-executive director since 1997 and has been confirmed by the Board as the
Company's senior independent director. All the non-executive directors are considered by the Board to be independent
of management and free of any relationship that could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent
judgement.
The Board meets regularly throughout the year. It considers all issues relating to the strategy, direction and future
development of the Group. The Board has a schedule of matters reserved to it for decision that is regularly updated.
The requirement for Board approval on these matters is understood and communicated widely throughout the Group.
The non-executive directors meet with the chairman separately during the year. In addition, the non-executive directors
meet without the chairman present to appraise the chairman's performance.
Operational decision making, operational performance and the formulation of strategic proposals to the Board are
controlled by an executive committee that comprises the chief executive, the finance director and subsidiary directors.
The executive committee meets regularly throughout the year.
To enable the Board to function effectively and the directors to discharge their responsibilities, full and timely access
is provided to all relevant information. There is an agreed procedure for directors to take independent professional
advice, if necessary, at the Company's expense. This is in addition to the access every director has to the Company
Secretary.

14 15 Audit Committee
During the period, Robert Breare was chairman of the audit committee and the other committee members were David
Bernstein, David Hewitt and Lord Stone of Blackheath. All the committee members are non-executive directors and
meet at least twice a year to review and approve the interim and annual financial statements, before submission for
approval by the Board and considers any matters raised by the auditors. The committee will consider significant
financial reporting judgements contained in the financial statements, including accounting policies and compliance,
areas of management judgements and estimates and the effectiveness of financial reporting and controls. The Board
considers all members to have relevant financial experience.
The audit committee oversees the Company's relationship with the external auditors and makes recommendations
to the Board in relation to their appointment, re-appointment and removal and approves their remuneration and
terms of engagement. The Board and committee also review the independence of the external auditors and considers
the engagement of the external auditors to supply non-audit services.
The committee is responsible for the review of the Company's procedures for responding to the allegations of
whistleblowers and the arrangements by which staff may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible financial
reporting irregularities.
Nomination Committee
During the period, Robert Breare was chairman of the nomination committee and the other committee members
were David Bernstein, David Hewitt and Lord Stone of Blackheath. All the committee members are non-executive
directors. The committee is responsible for nominating candidates for appointment to the Board. There were no
meetings during the period and no board appointments.
All non-executive directors are advised of the time commitment considered necessary to enable them to fulfil their
responsibilities prior to appointment.
Appointments to the Board
Newly appointed directors are given training appropriate to the level of their previous experience. Non-executive
directors meet regularly with members of the executive committee and other personnel within the organisation. In
addition, site visits ensure that the non-executive directors gain first hand experience of developments within
the Group.
Any director appointed during the year is required, under the provisions of the Company's Articles of Association,
to retire and seek re-election by the shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting.
The Company's Articles of Association require those directors who have been in office for at least two years from the
date of their original appointment (or from the date of their latest re-election if later) to retire from office.
Communication with Shareholders
The Group attaches considerable importance to the effectiveness of its communication with its shareholders. The full
report and accounts are sent to all shareholders and further copies are distributed to others with potential interest
in the Group's performance.
The directors seek to build on a mutual understanding of objectives between the Company and its institutional
shareholders by making general presentations after the interim and preliminary results; meeting shareholders to discuss
long-term issues and feedback; and communicating regularly throughout the year. All shareholders can gain access
to these presentations, as well as to the annual report and accounts and to other information about the Company,
through the website at www.tedbaker.co.uk. They may also attend the Company's Annual General Meeting at which
they have the opportunity to ask questions.
Non-executive directors are kept informed of the views of shareholders by the executive directors and are provided
with independent feedback from investor meetings.
16 Internal Control
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Group's system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
However, such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives,
and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
Following publication of guidance for directors on internal control Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the
Combined Code  ('the Turnbull guidance'), the Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying,
evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group, that has been in place for the year under review
and up to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts, and that this process is regularly reviewed by the
Board and accords with the guidance.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal control.  In particular, it has reviewed and updated
the process for identifying and evaluating the significant risks affecting the business and the policies and procedures
by which these risks are managed. Management is responsible for the identification and evaluation of significant risks
applicable to their areas of business together with the design and operation of suitable internal controls.  These risks
are assessed on a continual basis and may be associated with a variety of internal or external sources including control
breakdowns, disruption in information systems, competition, natural catastrophe and regulatory requirements.
The Group has an independent internal audit function whose findings are regularly reviewed by the executive committee
and the Board. The Audit Committee monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the internal audit activities.
Management reports regularly on its review of risks and how they are managed to the risk committee, whose main
role is to review, on behalf of the Board, the key risks inherent in the business and the system of control necessary to
manage such risks, and to present their findings to the Board.
The Chief Executive reports to the Board on behalf of the executive committee on significant changes in the business
and the external environment which affect significant risks. The finance director provides the Board with monthly
financial information which includes key performance indicators. Where areas for improvement in the system are
identified, the Board considers the recommendations made by the risk committee and the audit committee.
The risk committee includes the finance director and various heads of department. It reviews, on a twice yearly basis,
the risk management and control process and considers:
  the authority, resources and co-ordination of those involved in the identification, assessment and management
of significant risks faced by the Group;
  the response to the significant risks which have been identified by management and others;
  the maintenance of a control environment directed towards the proper management of risk; and
  the annual reporting procedures.
Additionally, the risk committee keeps abreast of all changes made to the systems and follows up on areas that require
improvement. It reports to the Board at twice yearly intervals or more frequently should the need arise.
