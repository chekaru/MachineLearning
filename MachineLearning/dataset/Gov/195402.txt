The Company is quoted on the 
Alternative Investment Market 
( AIM') of the London Stock 
Exchange plc and it is therefore 
not required to comply with the 
provisions and principles of good 
corporate governance and code 
of best practice (the  Combined 
Code'). Nevertheless, it is, where 
deemed appropriate, the intention 
of the Board to continue to comply 
with the Combined Code in so far 
as it is practicable for a group of 
its size.
The Board
The Board currently comprises 
the Non-Executive Chairman, 
Non-Executive Director, Chief 
Executive Offi cer, Finance Director, 
and Managing Director. The 
key features of the corporate 
governance structure are:
  The Non-Executive Chairman 
is closely involved with the 
development of the corporate 
strategy and fi nancing of the 
Group. He is also the Chairman 
of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees.
  The Non-Executive Director 
provides a range of skills and 
experience in the Group. He 
brings independent judgement 
on issues of strategy, 
performance, risk and people 
through his membership of 
the Board and Audit and 
Remuneration Committees.
  The Chief Executive Offi cer 
exercises his delegated powers 
through the management 
team comprising himself, the 
Managing Director and the 
Finance Director and senior 
members of management.
All Directors have access to 
the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary, who ensures 
that the Board meets formally 
at least eight times per year, 
receives appropriate and timely 
information for decision making, 
that Board procedures are 
followed and that statutory and 
regulatory requirements are met. 
Any Director, in order to fulfi l their 
duties, may take independent 
professional advice at the 
Company's expense. 
Under the retirement by rotation 
provisions of the Articles, at least 
one-third (or, if their number is not 
a multiple of three, the nearest 
number to (but not greater than) 
one-third) of the Directors of the 
Company at the time of the Annual 
General Meeting will be required 
to retire and seek re-election by 
shareholders at that meeting.
The Company does not have a 
Nomination Committee, which 
is not in compliance with the 
Combined Code. The Board 
as a whole is responsible for its 
structure, size, composition and 
successional needs.
The Non-Executive Chairman and 
Non-Executive Director would 
not be classifi ed as independent 
under the Combined Code due 
to participation in the Company's 
share option schemes due to: 
(i) the Non-Executive Chairman 
participating in the Company's 
share option scheme; and (ii) the 
Non-Executive Director being a 
signifi cant shareholder.
The Audit Committee
The Company has an established 
Audit Committee, comprising 
the Non-Executive Directors. 
The Audit Committee is chaired 
by M.P . Neville and has met 
three times this year. The Audit 
Committee is responsible 
for ensuring that appropriate 
fi nancial reporting procedures are 
properly maintained and reported 
on and for meeting with and 
recommending the appointment 
and resignation of the Company's 
Auditor and reviewing their 
reports on the accounts and the 
Company's internal controls.
The Remuneration Committee
The Company has an established 
Remuneration Committee, 
comprising the Non-Executive 
Directors. The Remuneration 
Committee is chaired by M.P .
Neville. The Remuneration 
Committee is responsible for 
reviewing the performance of 
the Executive Directors, for 
recommending the setting of their 
remuneration, for the determination 
of the payment of bonuses, and 
for considering the grant of options 
to Executive Directors under any 
share option scheme (including the 
price per share and the application 
of performance standards which 
may apply to any such grant).
Accountability and audit
The Board seeks to ensure that 
its annual report and fi nancial 
statements provide a balanced 
and concise assessment of the 
Company's position. All Board 
members have access to the 
external Auditor and Audit 
Committee meeting minutes. 
Risk assessment and
internal control
The Directors are responsible for 
risk assessment and the systems 
of internal control. Although no 
system of internal control can 
provide absolute assurance 
against material misstatement 
or loss, the Group's systems are 
designed to provide the Directors 
with reasonable assurance that 
problems are identifi ed on a timely 
basis and dealt with appropriately. 
The key elements of the Group's 
system of internal control are as 
follows:
Company management: The 
Chief Executive has put in place 
a clearly defi ned organisational 
structure, with well understood 
lines of responsibility, delegation of 
authority, accountability, policies 
and procedures and supported by 
training, budgeting, and reporting 
and review procedures. The 
Managing Director chairs senior 
management team meetings 
with responsibilities for sales, 
marketing, business development, 
customer service, technology 
and fi nance. Additionally, there 
are regular meetings of product 
strategy forums where the future 
direction of the Group's product 
offerings and routes to market
are considered.
Financial management: Detailed 
annual budgets are prepared for 
the Group. These budgets are

reviewed and agreed by the Board 
and actual performance is reported 
against these budgets on a regular 
basis. The Company has in place 
documented authority levels 
for approving purchase orders, 
invoices and all bank transactions. 
Further information concerning 
fi nancial risk management is 
detailed in the Business Review.
Quality management: The Group 
is focused on meeting the highest 
levels of customer satisfaction. 
Quality procedures for the 
development of the products, 
services and maintenance support 
are documented and reviewed 
frequently.
Internal audit: The Company 
does not operate an internal audit 
function; the Board feels that this 
is appropriate due to the current 
size of the Group's business.
External audit: Executive 
management have a dialogue with 
the external Auditor on matters 
arising from their work which is 
designed to express an opinion on 
the fi nancial statements.
Dialogue with shareholders
The Directors of the Company, 
together with the Company's 
advisers, hold meetings with the 
key shareholders, thereby helping 
to ensure that there is a mutual 
understanding of objectives.
Going concern
Based on the normal business 
planning and control procedures, 
the Directors have reasonable 
expectations that the Group 
will have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence 
for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason, the Directors continue to 
adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the accounts.
Statement of Directors' 
responsibilities
The Directors are responsible 
for keeping proper accounting 
records which disclose with 
reasonable accuracy at any 
time the fi nancial position of 
the group, for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company, for 
taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities and for 
the preparation of a Directors' 
Report which complies with the 
requirements of the Companies 
Act 1985.
The Directors are responsible 
for preparing the annual report 
and the fi nancial statements in 
accordance with the Companies 
Act 1985.  The Directors are 
also required to prepare fi nancial 
statements for the Group in 
accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European 
Union (IFRSs) and the rules of 
the London Stock Exchange for 
companies trading securities on 
the Alternative Investment Market.  
The Directors have chosen to 
prepare fi nancial statements for 
the Company in accordance 
with UK Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice.
Group fi nancial statements
International Accounting Standard 
1 requires that fi nancial statements 
present fairly for each fi nancial 
year the Group's fi nancial position, 
fi nancial performance and cash 
fl ows. This requires the faithful 
representation of the effects of 
transactions, other events and 
conditions in accordance with the 
defi nitions and recognition criteria 
for assets, liabilities, income 
and expenses set out in the 
International Accounting Standards 
Board's  Framework for the 
preparation and presentation of 
fi nancial statements'. In virtually all 
circumstances, a fair presentation 
will be achieved by compliance 
with all applicable IFRSs. A fair 
presentation also requires the 
Directors to:
  consistently select and apply 
appropriate accounting 
policies;
  present information, including 
accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, 
reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
  provide additional disclosures 
when compliance with the 
specifi c requirements in IFRSs 
is insuffi cient to enable users 
to understand the impact of 
particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the 
entity's fi nancial position and 
fi nancial performance.
Parent company fi nancial 
statements
Company law requires the 
Directors to prepare fi nancial 
statements for each fi nancial 
year which give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of 
the Company and of the profi t 
or loss of the Company for that 
period.  In preparing these fi nancial 
statements, the Directors are 
required to:
  select suitable accounting 
policies and then apply them 
consistently;
  prepare the fi nancial 
statements on the going 
concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that 
the Company will continue in 
business; 
  make judgements and 
estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; and state 
whether applicable accounting 
standards have been followed, 
subject to any material 
departures disclosed and 
explained in the fi nancial 
statements.
Financial statements are published 
on the Company's website in 
accordance with legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination 
of fi nancial statements, which 
may vary from legislation in other 
jurisdictions. The maintenance 
and integrity of the Company's 
website is the responsibility of 
the Directors. The Directors' 
responsibility also extends to the 
ongoing integrity of the fi nancial 
statements contained therein.
