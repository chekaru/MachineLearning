ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS
Notes on Financial Statements
For the year ended 31 December 2005
Corporate Governance
The Company is listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) and accordingly is not required to comply with the Combined
Code on Corporate Governance (the Combined Code ). The directors are committed to the principle of effective corporate
governance, support the principles contained in the Combined Code and apply these where they consider it appropriate to the
Company. The following report describes how the directors have addressed corporate governance in the year ended 31 December
2005.
The Board
The Board currently comprises three executive and one non-executive director. Magnus Mowat is the only independent director.
The Board meets usually monthly either in person or by telephone to set and monitor strategy, review trading performance and
formulate policy on key issues. Information of an appropriate quality is supplied in a timely manner to assist the directors to
perform their duties in an efficient manner. In addition, Board members have regular informal contact with each other.
From 26 April 2006, James Leek becomes the non-executive Chairman. Chris McDonnell is the Managing Director of the group's
operating business E Wood Limited.  
All directors have access to the advice and services of the company secretary who administers the Board and Board Committee
meetings and ensures that relevant procedures and regulations are followed. The Board has agreed that any director may obtain
independent professional advice at the Company's expense, in furtherance of their duties. Where it is considered appropriate,
training is made available to the directors.
Under the Company's Articles, the nearest number to one third of the Board retires each year by rotation. All directors are required
to offer themselves for re-election at least every three years.
Details of directors' contracts are included in the Remuneration Report on pages 15 and 16.
Board Committees
The Board has constituted itself as the Nominations Committee chaired by James Leek, and reviews the structure, size and
composition of the Board and the senior management organisation.  
The Audit Committee is chaired by Magnus Mowat with James Leek as the other member. The executive directors usually attend
meetings by invitation. The committee meets twice a year prior to the release of the full and half year results and on other occasions
as appropriate. The committee reviews reports from the external independent auditors, considers the appropriateness of the group's
financial and accounting policies and ensures that an objective and professional relationship is maintained with the external
independent auditors. At each committee meeting an opportunity exists for the external auditors to meet the senior independent
director without executive directors being present.
The Remuneration Committee ensures the executive directors and senior managers are appropriately rewarded. It is chaired by
Magnus Mowat with James Leek as the other member. James Leek does not participate in discussions about his own position.
Magnus Mowat will be available to answer questions at the annual general meeting.
Relations with shareholders
The Board seeks to maintain a good relationship with shareholders. This is achieved through the annual and interim reports and
the AGM. In addition, shareholders can access the Company and E Wood web sites to obtain information on the financial
performance of the group and products made and sold by E Wood. Meetings and discussions take place during the year with major
shareholders outside close periods. The AGM provides the principal forum for communication with smaller shareholders. All
directors attend the AGM and are available to answer questions.
The Company endeavours to give at least 20 working days notice of the AGM and the results of proxy votes are declared at the
meeting.
Internal controls
The Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining the group's system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
However, such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board has in place a framework to identify and monitor risks but has not carried out a formal detailed risk assessment for its
business nor carried out formal monitoring to ensure controls are in place to mitigate risks arising from the group's operations. The
Board does monitor performance very closely, including the management of risk of group businesses, by attendance at subsidiary
board meetings by the executive directors and a review of individual business performance and strategy at group board meetings.  33 14

The following procedures have been established to provide an effective control framework:
a) a comprehensive budgeting system with an annual budget approved by the Board;
b) monthly reporting of actual results and cash flows with comparisons to original  budget and updated forecasts;
c) clearly laid down authorisation levels for all types of expenditure and financial commitments;
d) the definition of a recognised organisation and management structure within which individual executive directors have
responsibility for the day to day management of the business;
e) completion of half yearly financial control self-certification questionnaires by subsidiary executive management, which are
reviewed by the group Board;  
f) a review of business risks is performed by the finance director through discussions with operating subsidiary management. This
aims to identify and address risk areas in the businesses;
g) management centrally of key areas such as legal matters and assessment of tax implications.
The Audit Committee overviews the monitoring of the adequacy of the group's internal financial control procedures, accounting
policies and financial reporting. It has considered the major business and financial risks, the control environment and information
on and arising from the procedures detailed above.
The directors have considered the establishment of an Internal Audit function. At present, they do not consider it appropriate but
will keep the matter under review.
Going concern
The directors have a reasonable expectation that both the Company and the group have adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the
accounts.
