Corporate governance statement 
The Group complies, so far as is practicable and appropriate for a Group of its size and nature, with 
the provisions of the Corporate Governance Code, as modified by the recommendations of the Quoted 
Companies Alliance (QCA). 
Board Structure 
The Board is responsible for formulating, reviewing and approving the Group's strategy, budgets and 
corporate actions. The Directors intend to hold monthly board meetings. The following committees 
were formed following the listing to AIM.  
Board Committees 
Audit committee 
During the year the Audit Committee comprised of Paul Hailes (Chair), Richard Feigen and Tom 
Maxfield. Meetings are also attended, by invitation, by the Chief Financial Officer. The Audit 
Committee is responsible for monitoring the quality of internal controls and ensuring that the financial 
performance of the Group is properly managed and reported on. It receives and reviews reports from 
the Group's management and external auditors  relating to the interim and annual accounts and the 
accounting and internal control systems in use throughout the Group. The Audit Committee meets at 
least twice in each financial year and has unrestricted access to the Group's external auditors. 
Remuneration Committee 
During the year the Remuneration Committee comprised of Paul Hailes (Chair) and Tom Maxfield. 
The remuneration Committee reviews the performance of the Executive Directors and makes 
recommendations to the Board on matters relating to their remuneration and terms of service. The 
Remuneration Committee also makes recommendations to the Board on proposals for the granting of 
share options and other equity incentives pursuant to any employee share option scheme or equity 
incentive plans in operation from time to time. The Remuneration Committee meets at least annually. 
In exercising this role, the Directors have regard to the recommendations put forward by the QCA 
Guidelines and, where appropriate, the Corporate Governance Code guidelines. 
Nomination Committee 
During the year the Nomination Committee consisted of Tom Maxfield (Chair), Paul Hailes and 
Richard Feigen. The Nomination Committee considers the selection and re-appointment of Directors. 
It identifies and nominates candidates to fill Board vacancies and reviews regularly the structure, size 
and composition (including skills, knowledge and experience) of the Board and makes 
recommendations to the Board with regard to changes. 
Internal Control 
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group's system of internal control and for reviewing the 
effectiveness of this system. Such a system can only be designed to manage, rather than eliminate, 
the risk of failure to achieve the business objectives and can therefore only provide reasonable and 
not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The Board are of the view that due to the current size and composition of the Group, that it is not 
necessary to establish an internal audit function.

Directors' responsibilities 
The directors are responsible for preparing the director's report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.  
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year.  Under that 
law the directors have elected to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union with the 
Company financial statements being prepared in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles.  Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of 
the profit or loss of the Group for that period.  The directors are also required to prepare financial 
statements in accordance with the rules of the London Stock Exchange for companies trading 
securities on the Alternative Investment Market.   
 
 
   
20 
 
 
In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to: 
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
  make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
  state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; 
  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume 
that the Company and Group will continue in business. 
 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and 
explain the Group's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006.  They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of 
the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other 
irregularities. 
 
Website publication 
The directors are responsible for ensuring the annual report and the financial statements are made 
available on a website.  Financial statements are published on the Company's website in accordance 
with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions.  The maintenance and integrity of 
the Company's website is the responsibility of the directors.  The directors' responsibility also extends 
to the ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained therein.
