 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Compliance with the
Combined Code
The new Combined Code came
into effect from 1 November
2003 and is applicable for all
accounting periods beginning
after that date.
For the year ended 31
December 2004, the Board
has carried out a full review of
the Group's compliance and
have complied throughout the
year with the principles of the
Combined Code (as set out in
Section 1 of the Combined
Code) with the exception of the
following items (references in
brackets are to provisions in
the Combined Code).
The directors consider that the
Group is not sufficiently large
enough to warrant the need for
certain requirements of the
Combined Code.
  The Board has 2 non-
executives, who although
considered independent,
have over 10 years service
and technically do not
therefore meet the
requirements of the new
code. It is the company's
intention in the coming year
to review these appoint-
ments and in some cases
seek replacements. However,
the effectiveness and
knowledge of the present
board is high and we will be
reluctant to implement too
rapid a change for purposes
of code adherence.
  Non-executive directors
should be appointed for
specified terms. Non-
executive directors are not
appointed for specific terms
although they are subject to
re-election to the Board
every three years (Provision
A.6.1). 
  All directors should be
subject to re-election at
intervals of no more than
three years. The Company's
Articles permit the Chief
Executive not to submit
himself for re-election
(Provision A.6.2). 
  Composition of the
Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration
Committee comprises
exclusively of three non-
executive directors; two 
of whom are independent
(Provision B.2.2). The
Combined Code states that
remuneration committees
should consist exclusively 
of non-executive directors
who are independent. 
The directors consider that the
Group is not sufficiently large
enough to warrant the need 
for certain requirements of 
the Combined Code, and
therefore the following
additional exceptions arise:
  Nominations Committee. 
No formal separate
Nominations Committee
exists (Provision A.5.1);
although a Committee of
non-executive directors 
and the Chief Executive 
was appointed to recruit 
Mr David Jones with the
assistance of appropriate
search consultants.
  The Board has considered
the need for internal audit,
but has decided that
because of the size of the
Group it cannot be justified
at present. The Board will
review this decision again
next year. (Provision D.2.2).
The Audit Committee do not
have formal arrangements by
which staff of the company
may, in confidence, raise
concerns about matters.
(Provision C3.4). This will 
be put in place.
Board of Directors
The Board of directors,
comprising three executive
directors and three non-
executive directors, of whom
two are considered
independent, meets regularly
throughout the year. It operates
within a structure in which roles
and responsibilities of the
Chairman, the Chief Executive,
the executive directors and 
the non-executive directors are
clearly established. The Board
is ultimately responsible for the
direction and management of
the Group. The Chief Executive
is charged with the
responsibility for running 
the Group within a defined
framework set by the Board 
in which certain matters are
reserved for the Board's
approval. (see page 21)
During 2004 the Board met 
10 times and all directors
attended all the meetings
except Mr J Read who resides
in USA. Mr Read is not
considered independent. Mr
Jones attended all meetings
following his appointment.
As recommended in the new
Combined Code, the Board
has carried out an internal
evaluation of it's performance,
the performance of it's
committees and it's individual
directors, by a system of self
assessment questionnaires 
and one to one meetings. 
This system of assessment
will be extended to continually
improve the performance of
the Board to the benefit of the
Company's stakeholders.
The following committees deal
with specific aspects of the
Group and provide
independent and objective
advice on important aspects
of the Group's affairs:
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is
chaired by Mr Brian Kent and
comprises the non-executive
directors, with the Chief
Executive and the Finance
Director in attendance. The
purpose of the committee is 
to ensure the preservation 
of good financial practices
throughout the Group; to
monitor that controls are in
force to ensure the integrity 
of financial information; to
review the interim and annual
financial statements; and 
to provide, by way of regular
meetings, a line of
communication between 
the Board and the external
auditors. Terms of Reference
are readily available on
request.
The Audit Committee ensures
that where the auditors also
provide non-audit services, 
the auditors' objectivity and
independence is safeguarded.
The Audit Committee
convened twice in the year, 
to meet with the Auditors to
discuss the year end audit, the
interim results and the audit
plan for the forthcoming year.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee
is chaired by Mr Brian Kent
and comprises the non-
executive directors with the
Chief Executive in attendance.
The Chief Executive is not in
attendance during discussions
on his own remuneration. The
Committee ensures that the
Group's executive directors
are fairly rewarded for their
individual contributions to the
Group's overall performance.
20 Wellington Holdings Annual Report 2004 In the year the Committee met
twice to discuss relevant
matters.
Internal control
The directors are responsible
for the Group's system of
internal control and for
reviewing its effectiveness,
which by its nature can only
provide reasonable and not
absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss
regarding:
i the safeguarding of assets
against unauthorised use 
or disposition; and
ii the maintenance of proper
accounting records and 
the reliability of financial
information used within the
business or for publication.
The Board confirms that there
is an ongoing process for
identifying, evaluating and
managing significant risks
faced by the Group, and that 
it has been in place for the
year under review and up to
the date of approval of the
Annual Report and Financial
Statements. The Board
reviews the effectiveness of its
control assessment system on
a regular basis, and at least
annually. This review includes
controls covering financial,
operational, compliance
controls and risk management.
The Board has established
procedures which are
designed to provide effective
internal control for the Group
and these include:
Control Environment and
Procedures
The directors have in place an
organisational structure with
clearly defined levels of
responsibility and delegation 
of authority. Group policies and
procedures are set out in
formal procedure manuals
which are held by all operating
companies. These include
annual budgets, detailed review
and appraisal procedures,
designated levels of authority
and levels for board approval. 
In particular, there are clearly
defined guidelines for the
review and approval of capital
expenditure projects and where
appropriate due diligence work
will be carried out when a
business is to be acquired.
It is Board policy that executive
directors receive suitable
training for their position, 
which is considered as part 
of the appraisal process.
The directors and operating
company management meet on
a regular basis to communicate
the Group's commitment to
professionalism and
competence.
Operating units prepare self-
certification statements which
describe the extent of their
compliance with control
objectives. These statements
are reviewed by the executive
directors and the control
systems are monitored by 
the Group Finance director. 
Risk Management
The directors and operating
company management have 
a clear responsibility for
identifying risks facing each of
the businesses and for putting
in place procedures to mitigate
and monitor risks. Risks are
formally assessed during the
annual budget process, which
is monitored by the Board, and
the ongoing Group strategy
process.
Financial Reporting
The Group has a comprehensive
system of financial reporting.
There is a detailed budgeting
system in place which
includes the plan of each
operating company being
approved by the executive
directors and the Board
approves the overall Group
budget. On a monthly basis,
actual results are reported
against budget and any
significant adverse variances
examined and remedial action
taken.
Revised forecasts for the 
year are prepared each
quarter. Rolling quarterly 
cash forecasts are prepared
on a monthly basis.
Dialogue with shareholders
The Group undertakes on 
a regular basis, where
practicable, to meet with
shareholders and enter into a
dialogue based on the mutual
understanding of objectives.
The Group has a website;
www.wellingtonholdings.com
which is continually updated 
to ensure that shareholders
are fully aware of the Group's
activities. 
The Chairman of the Audit and
Remuneration Committees will
normally be available to speak
to shareholders at the AGM. 
In addition, shareholders can
contact him at any time by
writing to the Group's address.
Going Concern
After making appropriate
enquiries that the Group has
adequate resources to
continue in operation for the
foreseeable future, the Board
considers that the Group's
finances are sound. For this
reason they continue to adopt
the going concern basis in
preparing the financial
statements.
