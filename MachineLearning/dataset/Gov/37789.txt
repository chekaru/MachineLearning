Corporate Governance
Policy Statement
The company, though not
required to comply, fully supports
the Principles of Good
Governance and the Code of
Best Practice prepared by the
Committee on Corporate
Governance published in June
1998 (the Combined Code ). The
company, other than as stated
below, has been in full
compliance with the provisions set
out in the Combined Code
throughout the year to
31 December 2003.
Board Constitution and
Procedures
The Board comprises two
executive and three non-
executive directors. The roles of
Chairman and Chief Executive
are separate with a clear division
of responsibilities. The non-
executive directors bring a wealth
of experience from widely
different backgrounds and the
Board considers that, subject to as
set out below, they are
independent. Mr A.P. Baker, who is
also the Company Secretary, is a
partner in Clyde & Co, the
Company's legal advisers. In the
opinion of the Board his
independence is not materially
impaired by virtue of this role. Mr
A.P. Baker is the senior non-
executive director to whom any
concerns may be conveyed.
The Board meets monthly to
consider the current state of the
business and strategic issues, and
there is a formal schedule of
matters specifically reserved for its
decision which can only be
amended by the Board itself. This
includes acquisition and
investment policy, major capital
expenditure, annual operating
budgets, health and safety issues
and the Group management and
control structure and procedures.
Arrangements are in place to
deal with exceptional
circumstances when decisions
reserved for the Board are
required between meetings.
Board papers, including
management accounts, are
distributed well in advance of the
meetings.
Non-executive directors have
access to all information and, if
required, external advice, at the
expense of the company. All
directors have access to the
Company Secretary, whose
removal and appointment is a
matter for the Board as a whole
and who is responsible to the
Board for ensuring that agreed
procedures and applicable rules
and regulations are observed.
The Board has responsibility for
selecting suitable candidates to
hold office as director. The
appointments of non-executives
are capable of being renewed at
the discretion of the full Board
every three years and at the
discretion of shareholders when
seeking re-election at Annual
General Meetings.
Selection Criteria for our Non-
Executive Directors
We wanted to create a team of
non-executive directors with a
balance of knowledge,
experience and skills combined
with personal chemistry that
ensures that the team functions to
its maximum potential. In order to
comply with the revised
Combined Code on the
independence of directors, we
ensured that on appointment, our
new non-executive Chairman is
clearly independent in all
respects. However, given the
relatively small size of the Group,
the recent trading history, the
amount of recent change and
our move to the AIM market we
decided that it was important to
retain the experience and skills of
our other non-executive directors
even though they are not
considered independent by the
test of the revised Combined
Code. Both Ken Manley and
Andrew Baker have served on the
Board for longer than 9 years. Ken
also represents a significant
shareholding, held by his partner.
Clyde & Co, where Andrew is a 26
Corporate Governance
partner, acts as the Group's
solicitors. 
Christian Williams, appointed
December 2003
We looked for somebody who
had a well-established reputation
within the financial markets and a
broad business background
outside our industry to bring a
wider perspective to our decision-
making. We also looked for
somebody who had been
involved in helping businesses
through significant change.
Having previous senior executive
experience in the turnaround of
the food retailer, Budgens plc, our
new Chairman brings all these
attributes and moreover shares
our vision for the future of the
business. Christian was appointed
after a search using a number of
independent external City
advisers for recommendations
and is clearly independent in all
respects as defined by the new
Combined Code. 
Ken Manley, appointed May 1994
We wanted to retain an intimate
knowledge and experience of our
business and the food industry
generally and an enthusiasm for
the continued development of
the business. With his wider
interests as a non-executive
director of various private
companies and his vast
knowledge and experience of our
and similar food businesses, Ken
brings a pragmatic approach to
our decision-making. 
Andrew Baker, appointed
September 1984
With the changing nature of our
business we sought an individual
who could offer help and advice
on the current and forthcoming
legislation and also on potential
acquisitions and divestments. As a
senior partner in one of the UK's
leading Law firms and as a non-
executive director of a financial
institution, Andrew brings a clarity
of thought and action that
ensures the Board are always
making decisions from the best
informed position.
Both Ken and Andrew were
existing directors of the business
prior to its name change to
Canterbury Foods Group plc. 
Board Committees
The Board has established an
Audit Committee and a
Remuneration Committee, the
members of which are indicated
on page 23. 
The Audit Committee meets at
least twice annually and, in
addition, the auditors may request
a meeting at any time. The Audit
Committee is responsible for
reviewing a wide range of matters
including the interim and annual
accounts prior to their submission
to the Board. The Audit
Committee keeps under review
the appointment and
remuneration of external auditors,
their cost-effectiveness,
independence and objectivity.
Both Committees currently consist
of only non-executive directors.
The Remuneration Committee is
responsible for determining the
remuneration, contract terms and
other benefits of the executive
directors. The Directors'
Remuneration Report is set out on
pages 28 to 30.
Internal Control
The Board is responsible for the
Group's system of internal control,
financial and otherwise, and for
reviewing its effectiveness.
However, such a system is
designed to manage rather than
eliminate the risk of failure to
achieve business objectives, and
can provide only reasonable and
not absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss.
The Combined Code introduced
a requirement (the Turnbull
guidance) that the directors
review the effectiveness of the
Group's system of internal control,
covering all aspects of the
business. The Board has an
ongoing process for identifying, 27
evaluating and managing risks. It
has established a risk assessment
committee and, with the
assistance of external consultants,
it ensures that plans are in place
to manage these risks and to
undertake a periodic review of
controls.
The Board has in place an
organisational structure with
clearly defined lines of
responsibility and delegation of
authority. All operations prepare
annual plans and budgets, which
are updated regularly.
Performance against budgets is
monitored at operational level
and centrally, with variances
being reported promptly. There
are clearly defined guidelines for
capital expenditure appraisal
review procedures and levels of
authority. The Board has reviewed
the need for an Internal Audit
function and concluded that the
current practice of using external
resources as necessary remains
the most effective solution.
Relations with Shareholders
The company actively seeks to
enter into dialogue with
institutional shareholders including
presentations after the company's
preliminary and interim results. It
also endorses the Combined
Code principles generally on the
conduct of the Annual General
Meetings including that such
meetings be used as an
opportunity for effective
communication with private
shareholders whose participation
in the proceedings should be
encouraged.
The Board recognises its
responsibilities to provide a
balanced and understandable
assessment of the Company's
performance and prospects. This
is reflected in these financial
statements in the Chairman's
Statement, the Review of
Operations and the Financial
Review.
Statement of Directors'
Responsibilities
Company law requires the
directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year
which give a true and fair view of
the state of affairs of the
company and the Group as at
the end of the financial year and
of the profit or loss of the Group
for that period. In preparing those
financial statements, the directors
are required to:
  Select suitable accounting
policies and them apply them
consistently;
  Make judgements and
estimates that are reasonable
and prudent;
  Prepare the financial
statements on the going
concern basis unless it is
inappropriate to presume that
the company and the Group
will continue in business;
  State whether applicable
accounting standards have
been followed, subject to any
material departures disclosed
and explained in the financial
statements.
The directors are responsible for
keeping proper accounting
records which disclose with
reasonable accuracy at any time
the financial position of the
company and the Group and to
enable them to ensure that the
financial statements comply with
the Companies Act 1985. They
are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the
company and the Group and
hence for taking reasonable steps
for the prevention and detection
of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are also responsible
for ensuring that the Directors'
Report, the Directors'
Remuneration Report and other
information included in the
Annual Report is prepared in
accordance with company law in
the United Kingdom.
