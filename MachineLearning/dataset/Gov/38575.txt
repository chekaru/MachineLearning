independent auditors' report 
to the members of Carclo plc
We have audited the group and parent company financial statements (the  'financial statements'') of Carclo plc for the year ended 31 March 
2008 which comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated and parent company balance sheets, the consolidated statement 
of cash flows, the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense and the related notes. These financial statements have been 
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the directors' remuneration report that is 
described as having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work 
has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company 
and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors' responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the group financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs ) as adopted by the EU, and for preparing the parent company financial statements and the 
directors' remuneration report in accordance with applicable law and UK Accounting Standards (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) 
are set out in the statement of directors' responsibilities on pages 22 and 23.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the directors' remuneration report to be audited in accordance with 
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the 
part of the directors' remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as 
regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in 
the directors' report is consistent with the financial statements. The information given in the directors' report includes that specific information 
presented in the chairman's statement and the chief executive's and finance director's reviews that are cross referred from the business review 
section of the directors' report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors' remuneration and other 
transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the statement of Corporate Governance reflects the company's compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 Combined 
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to 
consider whether the board's statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the group's 
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. 
We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial 
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part 
of the directors' remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the 
directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group's and company's 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide 
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the directors' remuneration report to be 
audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated 
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the directors' remuneration report to be 
audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
the group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, of the state of the group's affairs 
as at 31 March 2008 and of its profit for the year then ended;
the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation;
the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the 
state of the parent company's affairs as at 31 March 2008;
the parent company financial statements and the part of the directors' remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
the information given in the directors' report is consistent with the financial statements.
