 General
Castings P .L.C. recognises the importance 
of high standards of Corporate 
Governance. The board has considered 
the principles and provisions of the 
Combined Code published in 2006 and 
will continue to adhere to them where it 
is in the interests of the business, and of 
shareholders, to do so.
Internal control
The Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance introduced a requirement 
that the directors review the effectiveness 
of the group's systems of internal controls. 
This extended the existing requirement 
in respect of internal financial controls 
to cover all controls including financial, 
operational and compliance controls and 
risk management.
The board is ultimately responsible for 
the group's system of internal controls, 
including internal financial control, and 
for monitoring its effectiveness. There 
is a continuous process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the significant 
risks faced by the group which is 
regularly reviewed and has been in place 
throughout the year under review and 
up to the date of approval of the annual 
report and accounts. However, such a 
system is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can provide only 
reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. 
The review covers all controls including 
financial, operational, compliance and risk 
management.
The directors confirm that they have 
established procedures necessary to 
implement the guidance for directors on 
the Combined Code such that they fully 
comply with it for the accounting period 
ended on 31st March 2009.
Internal financial control
The directors are responsible for 
maintaining the group's systems of 
internal financial control. These controls 
are designed to both safeguard the 
group's assets and ensure the reliability 
of financial information used within the 
business and for publication. As with any 
such systems, controls can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
Internal financial control is operated 
within a clearly defined organisational 
structure with clear control responsibilities 
and authorities, and a practice throughout 
the group of regular management and 
board meetings to review all aspects of 
the group's businesses including those 
aspects where there is a potential risk to 
the group.
For each business there are regular 
weekly and monthly reports, reviewed by 
boards and management, which contain 
both written reports and accounts. The 
accounts include profit and loss accounts 
and balance sheets for the period under 
review, year to date and previous year and 
are compared with expected results. A 
variety of operational and financial ratios 
are also produced.
Continual monitoring of the systems of 
internal financial control is conducted by all 
management. The external auditors, who 
are engaged to express an opinion on the 
group accounts, also consider the systems 
of internal financial control to the extent 
necessary to express that opinion. The 
external auditors report the results of their 
work to management, including members 
of the board and the audit committee.
The board does not consider there is a 
need for an internal audit function due to 
the size and complexity of the group.
Auditors' independence
The non-audit work undertaken in the year 
by the group auditors, BDO Stoy Hayward 
LLP , was restricted to an involvement in 
the preparation of the tax computations 
and related tax advice of the group 
companies and a review of the interim 
financial statements.
Environment
The board recognises that our operations 
have an effect on the local, regional and 
global environment, and as a consequence 
of this, the board is committed to adopting 
policies, processes and procedures which 
will lead to the continual improvement 
in environmental performance and the 
prevention of pollution.
Directors' conflicts of 
interest
From 1st October 2008, a director has 
had a statutory duty to avoid a situation in 
which he has, or can have, an interest that 
conflicts or possibly may conflict with the 
interests of the company. A director will 
not breach that duty if the relevant matter 
has been authorised in accordance with 
the Articles of Association by the other 
directors. 
The board has conducted a review of 
actual or possible conflicts of interest in 
respect of each director. At its meeting on 
2nd October 2008, the board considered 
the process for identifying current 
conflicts, authorised conflicts that have 
been identified and stipulated conditions 
in accordance with the guiding principles 
and agreed a process to identify and 
authorise future conflicts. In practice, 
directors are asked to consider and 
disclose actual or potential conflicts at 
the beginning of each meeting and as and 
when a matter arises.
Board of directors
The board meets regularly to monitor the 
current state of business and to determine 
its future strategic direction. During the 
year the board comprised five executive 
directors and three non-executive 
directors. Two of the non-executive 
directors are independent of executive 
management and none of the non-
executive directors participate in share 
option or other executive remuneration 
schemes nor do they qualify for pension 
benefits. p o r t 2 0 0 9 13 A n n u a l R e p o r t 2 0 0 9

Although the non-executive directors 
have served for more than nine years their 
knowledge, advice and controls are still 
invaluable to the group.
Directors receive regular updates 
appropriate to the business throughout 
the year.
To assist with the conduct of their 
function, the non-executive directors 
are able to obtain professional advice 
at the company's expense if required in 
connection with their duties. In addition, 
all directors have access to the services of 
the company secretary.
Board committees
The principal committees established by 
the directors are:
Audit committee
This committee comprised the three 
non-executive directors and is chaired 
by C. P . King. The finance director and 
other executive directors may also attend 
meetings as appropriate to the business in 
hand but are not members of the committee.
The committee meets at least twice a 
year and examines any matters relating to 
the financial affairs of the group including 
the review of annual and interim results, 
internal control procedures and accounting 
practices. The audit committee meets with 
the auditors periodically and as necessary.
Remuneration committee
As detailed in the remuneration report 
below.
Nomination committee
This committee comprised the three 
non-executive directors and is chaired 
by G. B. Wainwright. The chairman may 
attend meetings as appropriate to the 
business in hand but is not a member of 
the committee.
Relations with 
shareholders
The company holds meetings from time 
to time with institutional shareholders 
to discuss the company's strategy and 
financial performance. The Annual General 
Meeting is used to communicate with 
private and institutional investors.
Going Concern
The directors have assessed the future 
funding requirements of the group and the 
company and compared them to the level 
of funding available. Details of cash and 
borrowing facilities are set out in note 20 
to the accounts. The group's objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its 
capital, its financial risk management 
objectives, details of its financial 
instruments and hedging activities, and its 
exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk are 
also set out in note 20 to the accounts.
The directors' assessment included a 
review of the group's financial forecasts, 
and financial instruments for the 15 
months from the balance sheet date. The 
directors considered a range of potential 
scenarios within the key markets the group 
serves and how these may impact on cash 
flow. The group and company's business 
activities, together with the factors likely to 
affect its future development, performance 
and position are set out in the chairman's 
statement on page 3. The directors also 
considered what mitigating actions the 
group could take to limit any adverse 
consequences.
After making these enquiries, the 
directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the company and the group have 
adequate resources to continue operations

for the foreseeable future. For this reason, 
they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements.
Summary
The board takes its responsibilities 
seriously even though there are a number 
of the provisions of the Code with which it 
does not comply. It does not feel that the 
size or complexity of the group and the way 
in which it governs would be enhanced 
or strengthened by further changing 
the already existing high standards of 
corporate governance practised.
For the year ended 31st March 2009 
the company complied with the Combined 
Code other than the following points:
l There are three non-executive 
directors but one does not conform to 
the definition of independent. Although 
these directors have served for more 
than nine years the board recognises 
the value they bring and believe it is 
important too that shareholders have 
the reassurance of non-executives 
on the board whose independence is 
beyond question. 
l The non-executive directors do not 
have specified term contracts.
l The chairman is also regarded as an 
executive director but on reduced 
hours. However, the chief executive is 
responsible for the day to day running 
of the group with direct responsibility 
for the Brownhills site and through 
the managing directors of William Lee 
and CNC Speedwell. The chairman 
concentrates on the effective working 
of the board and overall group 
strategies and remains a high level 
contact with our main customers. 
l The role of the financial director and 
company secretary are fulfilled by the 
same person as there is no one else 
within the group qualified to do the job 
and it would not be a full-time position. 
The board monitors the effectiveness 
of this arrangement annually.
l There is no formal arrangement 
whereby staff may, in confidence, raise 
concerns about possible improprieties 
in matters of financial reporting or 
other matters.
These are considered appropriate in 
relation to the size of the company and the 
way in which it operates.
