 Corporate Governance Statement
The Company is committed to
the principles of corporate
governance contained in the
Combined Code on Corporate
Governance which is appended
to the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority
and for which the board of
directors is accountable to
shareholders. 
Statement of Compliance with the
Code of Best Practice
Throughout the year ended 31
December 2003, the Company has
been in compliance with the Code
provisions set out in Section 1 of the
Hampel Code with the limited
exception of the following matter:
  Provision 1.7 indicates a preference
for the length of service contracts of
directors to be not greater than one
year. J Richardson, the Chief
Executive of the Group, has a service
contract with an eighteen month
notice of termination from either
party. The remuneration committee
considers this necessary to attract
and retain an appropriate candidate
for the position.
Statement about applying the
Principles of Good Governance
The Combined Code establishes
fourteen Principles of Good
Governance. Further explanation of
how the Principles have been applied
is set out below and, in conjunction
with directors' remuneration, in the
Directors' Remuneration Report.
Board of directors
The board has a formal schedule of
matters specifically reserved to it for
decision making and is responsible for
the overall strategy and direction of
the Group and for approving
acquisitions and disposals,
management performance, major
capital and development expenditures
and significant financing matters. It
delegates authority to committees of
directors on other matters. The board
of directors meets at frequent
intervals throughout the year and
retains full and effective control over
the Company.
All directors have access to the
advice and services of the Company
Secretary, and all directors are able
to take independent professional
advice, if necessary, at the
Company's expense.
Non-executive directors - The non-
executive directors, with the exception
of M Gordon, are independent of
management and monitor management's
actions and the Group's performance.
In forming its conclusion on the
independence of the non-executive
directors serving more than one term,
the Board has considered the length
of service Messrs Sinclair and Kitchner
have served as non-executive directors
as well as their shareholding as disclosed
in note 4 to the financial statements.
Individually, the non-executive
directors are kept fully informed of
major operational and strategic issues
by the Chief Executive and Company
Secretary which may arise between
Board meetings. The non-executive
directors are encouraged to meet with
members of senior management and
the non-executive chairman visited
the operations in the US during 2003.
Board committees
N Sinclair chairs the Remuneration
Committee, which includes H Kitchner
and A Elbrick from 24 April 2003. The
Remuneration Committee operates
within defined terms of reference and
is responsible for determining
contract terms, remuneration and
other benefits for executive directors.
A Elbrick joined the Audit Committee
and was appointed chairman from 24
April 2003. The Committee also
includes N Sinclair and H Kitchner,
who was the past chairman. All
members of the Committee are
independent non-executive directors.
The Audit Committee reviews the
financial information as reported to
shareholders and operates within
defined terms of reference. It meets
at least twice per year with the
external auditors to review audit
procedures, internal controls and
financial reporting matters. It also
recommends the appointment of the
Company's external auditors and their
remuneration for both audit and non-
audit work. The auditors have
unrestricted access to the Audit
Committee.
There is no Nomination Committee
as the Board as a whole considers
the appointment of directors.
Division of responsibilities
between Chairman and Chief
Executive
The board has shown its commitment
to dividing responsibilities for running
the board and running the Company's
business by: having H Kitchner as a
non-executive chairman, J Richardson
as the Chief Executive and naming 
A Elbrick as the senior independent
director.
Regular re-election of directors
All directors submit themselves for 
re-election at least once every three
years. Newly appointed directors are
submitted for election at the first
opportunity after their appointment.
Timeliness and quality of board
information
The Board has sought to ensure that
directors are properly briefed on
issues arising at Board meetings by
establishing procedures for
distributing Board papers in advance
of meetings, providing monthly
financial and operational information
to non-executive directors, and
making the Company Secretary
responsible to the Board for the
timeliness and quality of information.
6 Clinical Computing Plc Dialogue with institutional
shareholders
The directors seek to build on a
mutual understanding of objectives
between the Company and its
institutional shareholders by making
regular strategic presentations to
them and meeting to discuss long-
term issues and obtain feedback.
The Annual Report and Accounts and
half year Interim Report are sent to all
shareholders. All shareholders have at
least twenty working days' notice of
the Annual General Meeting. There 
is an opportunity for individual
shareholders to question the
Chairman and heads of committees 
at the Annual General Meeting. 
In addition, the Company has
established a web site to further 
aid communications.
The Company endeavours to respond
promptly to queries received from all
shareholders.
Environmental ethics
The Board recognises that the nature
of the Group's business ensures that
direct impact on the environment is
inherently limited. However, every
effort is made to ensure the
environmental impact of the Group's
operational practices is kept to a
practicable minimum, including strict
adherence to all existing and new
statutory requirements.
Maintenance of a sound system of
internal control and reviewing its
effectiveness
The directors recognise that they
have overall responsibility for
ensuring that the Group's system of
internal control to provide them with
reasonable assurance regarding
effective and efficient operations,
internal financial control and
compliance with laws and regulations.
The system is designed to manage
rather than to eliminate risk of failure
to achieve the Group's business
objectives. There are inherent
limitations in any system of internal
control and accordingly even the most
effective system can provide only
reasonable, and not absolute,
assurance against material
misstatement, losses or fraud.
The key features of the internal
control system that operated
throughout the period covered by 
the accounts are described below:
Control environment
The Group has developed an
organisational structure with clearly
established responsibilities and lines
of accountability. The Group does not
operate an internal audit function, as
the Board considers that the small
size of the Group and the monitoring
controls in place make it unnecessary.
Identification and evaluation of risks
The composition of the Board and 
of senior management is aimed at
providing an appropriate range of
knowledge, skill and experience in
scientific, medical software and
commercial matters. Key risk areas
are reviewed regularly at each board
meeting by executive management
and the Board.
Functional reporting 
The Group has identified a number 
of areas which are subject to regular
reporting to Board members. These
include major project performance,
software development projects,
financing requirements and legal
matters.
Financial reporting
There is a comprehensive system 
for reporting performance. At the
beginning of each year a budget is
approved by the Board. There is a
monthly comparison of results against
this budget for each operating unit.
Forecasts are updated regularly
throughout the year.
Quality and integrity of personnel
The integrity of the Group is
maintained through the appointment
of experienced and professional staff.
Every director receives appropriate
training on the first occasion that he
or she is appointed to the Board, and
subsequently as necessary.
Compliance monitoring
The Board has applied Principle D.2
of the Combined Code by
establishing a continuous process for
identifying, evaluating and managing
the significant risks the Group faces.
The Board regularly reviews the
process, which has been in place from
the start of the year to the date of
approval of this report and which is 
in accordance with Internal Control:
Guidance for Directors on the
Combined Code published in
September 1999 and the guidance
published by the Internal Control
Working Party of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England
and Wales (the Turnbull Report).
In compliance with Provision D.2.1 
of the Combined Code, the Board
reviews the effectiveness of the
Group's system of internal control
and has taken account of material
developments that have taken place
since 31 December 2003. The
Board's monitoring covers all controls,
including financial, operational and
compliance controls and risk
management. It is based principally
on reviewing reports from
management to consider whether
significant risks are identified,
evaluated, managed and controlled
and whether any significant
weaknesses are promptly remedied
and indicate a need for more
extensive monitoring. The Audit
Committee assists the Board in
discharging its review responsibilities.
Going concern
After making enquiries and reviewing
managements' projects, the directors
have formed a judgment, at the time
of approving the financial statements,
that there is a reasonable expectation
that the Group has adequate
resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason the directors continue
to adopt the going concern basis in
preparing the financial statements.
