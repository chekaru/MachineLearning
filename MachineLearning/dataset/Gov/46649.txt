Corporate Governance
Whilst the Board supports the provisions of the Code of Best
Practice embodied in Section 1 of the Combined Code (2006),
the size and nature of the Group does not warrant compliance
with all of the Combined Code's requirements. The statements
below set out how the principles are applied to the Group. 
Board of directors
The Group is headed by the Board, which comprises the 
non-executive Chairman, a non-executive director and 
the Chief Executive. Biographical information on all present
Board members is presented on page 5. 
The Board has a formal schedule of matters specifically
reserved to it for decision-making and is responsible for the
overall strategy and direction of the Group. The Chairman is
responsible for leadership of the Board, ensuring its
effectiveness and that it operates in the interest of
shareholders. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for
leadership of the business and implementation of strategy. 
The non-executive directors constructively challenge and help
develop proposals on strategy, review the Chief Executive's
performance through the Remuneration Committee, and
ensure the integrity of financial information through the Audit
Committee. Matters specifically reserved for decision by the full
Board include the following material transactions: acquisitions
and disposals, litigation, capital and development expenditures,
financing matters and any transaction with a related party. 
The names of the Directors, their respective roles and
committees during 2007 is detailed in the Directors' Report 
on page 6. 
The full Board met five times during 2007 and all members of
the Board attended each meeting. 
Board balance and independence
The Board annually evaluates its balance and independence
and considers that it meets the general guidance on board
balance. S Newman is independent in character and
judgement and no relationships or circumstances requiring
further consideration with respect to their independence is
known to the Board. 
The Company will continue to evaluate the succession 
planning of the Board with respect to Code guidance and 
any other circumstances that will enhance the performance 
of the Company.
Board committees
The following committees, which have written terms of
reference (which are available on our web site - www.ccl.com
or on request from the Company Secretary), deal with specific
aspects of the Group's affairs.
  The Remuneration Committee is chaired by S Newman and
includes H Kitchner. The Remuneration Committee operates
within defined terms of reference and is responsible for
determining contract terms, remuneration and other benefits
for each of the executive directors, including performance
related bonus schemes, pension rights and compensation
payments. The Board itself determines the remuneration of the
non-executive directors. The report of Directors' remuneration
is set out of pages 11 to 13. The committee met once last year
and the meeting was attended by S Newman and H Kitchner. 
  The Audit Committee is chaired by S Newman and includes
H Kitchner. The Audit Committee operates within defined terms
of reference and is responsible for reviewing the integrity of
information reported to shareholders, the controls around the
development of such information and reviewing the scope of
the external audit. The Audit Committee recommends the
appointment of the Company's external auditors and their
remuneration for both audit and non-audit work. The auditors
have unrestricted access to the Audit Committee. 
The Committee met once last year and the meeting was
attended by S Newman and H Kitchner. 
  The Company does not maintain a formal Nomination
Committee. 
Information and professional development
Between formal board meetings, non-executive directors are
kept informed of major operational and strategic issues by the
Chairman and Chief Executive. The non-executive directors are
encouraged to meet with members of the senior management
team and Chairman between board meetings. Each board
meeting normally includes a presentation by one of the
members of the senior management team. 
All directors have access to the advice and services of the
Company Secretary, and all directors are able to take
independent professional advice, if necessary, at the
Company's expense.
Financial reporting 
The directors acknowledge their responsibility to prepare a
balanced and understandable assessment of the Company's
position and prospects. The Chairman's statement which forms
part of the annual and interim reports to shareholders is the
primary communication vehicle to all shareholders.
Going concern
After making enquiries and reviewing managements'
projections, and providing for a debt facility of  1,000,000 and
considering the  545,000 fundraising undertaken in February
2008, the directors have formed a judgment, at the time of
approving the financial statements, that there is a reasonable
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason the directors continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Internal control and risk management system
The directors recognise that they have overall responsibility for
ensuring and reviewing that the Group's system of internal
control and risk management provides reasonable assurance
regarding effective and efficient operations, internal financial
control and compliance with laws and regulations. The system
is designed to manage rather than to eliminate risk of failure to
achieve the Group's business objectives. There are inherent
limitations in any system of internal control and accordingly
even the most effective system can provide only reasonable,
and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement,
losses or fraud. Steps are being taken to embed internal
control and risk management further into the operations of the
business and to deal with areas of improvement which come
to management's and the Board's attention.

Risk management Process
There is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and
managing the significant risks faced by the Group. It has been
in place for the year under review and up to the date of
approval of the annual report and financial statements. The
process is embedded into each Board meeting and therefore
regularly reviewed by the Board. The Board believes that this
process and review accords with the Turnbull guidance.
The key features of the internal control system that operated
throughout the period covered by the accounts are described
below:
Evaluation of key risks
The composition of the Board and senior management team is
aimed at providing an appropriate range of knowledge, skill
and experience with respect to medical practice, software
development and commercial matters impacting the overall
environment in which the Group operates. Key risk areas are
reviewed regularly at board meetings. The following matters
received the focus of the Board during the year:
  The development processes for the Clinical Vision product
  The quality assurance testing process
  Customer satisfaction
  Staff development, recruiting and remuneration
  Financial resources and forecasting
At each board meeting the Chief Executive Officer updates the
Board on current business matters and submits a financial
forecast and between meetings provides weekly and monthly
reports to the non-executive directors. 
Control environment
The Group has developed an organisational structure with
clearly established responsibilities and lines of accountability
and procedures. The senior management team holds bi-annual
meetings to review, document and agree its operating plan,
including the control structure and reporting process
supporting the plan. This provides a framework for the
executive directors to adjust the written policies, processes
and behaviours of staff members as may be necessary. This
process also provides the non-executive directors the
opportunity to evaluate the key risks facing the Group. The
senior management team meets weekly to review operational
matters and reports.
There are no significant issues disclosed in the report and
financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007
and up to the date of approval of the report and financial
statements that have required the Board to deal with any
related material internal control issues. 
Internal audit 
The Group does not operate an internal audit function, as the
Board considers that the small size of the Group makes it
unnecessary.
Auditor independence
Through its Audit Committee, the Company has reviewed a
report from its auditors, Baker Tilly UK Audit LLP , confirming in
their professional judgement, their independence. The review
included all services provided by Baker Tilly UK Audit LLP and
its related entities. The Audit Committee concluded that there
are sufficient controls in place to ensure the continued
independence of the auditors. 
Dialogue with institutional shareholders
The directors seek to build on a mutual understanding of
objectives between the Company and its institutional
shareholders by making regular strategic presentations to them
and meeting to discuss long-term issues and obtain feedback.
Presentations on strategy are typically made to the institutional
shareholders by the Chief Executive Officer.
Constructive use of Annual General Meeting
All shareholders have at least twenty working days' notice of
the Annual General Meeting. There is an opportunity for
individual shareholders to question the Chairman and heads of
committees at the Annual General Meeting.
