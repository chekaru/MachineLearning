By Order of the Board
B R Hartog
Company Secretary
19 October 2007 COMBINED CODE COMPLIANCE
The Board agrees with the general principles contained in the 2003
Combined Code on Corporate Governance.  However, in view of the
size of the Company and its current management structure, not all of
the recommendations have been adopted in their entirety.  Those that
have not been adopted are disclosed below.  Our compliance with the
2003 Combined Code is kept under review.
DIRECTORS
The Board of Directors comprises seven executive directors and three
non-executive directors.  A short biography of each director and the
positions held by executive directors is given on pages 8 and 9.  There
is a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for the Board's
approval.  Before each meeting, a detailed agenda together with a
comprehensive management information pack is provided to each
director.  The Board discusses and approves, among other things,
group strategy, capital expenditure, annual budgets, corporate
governance issues, accounting policies, internal control and dividend
policy.   It monitors and questions monthly performance and reviews
anticipated results.  Day to day management of the Group is
delegated to the executive directors.   All of the executive directors
have written service contracts with varying periods of determination
but none longer than six months.
One area of non-compliance is that the role of Chairman and Chief
Executive is currently a combined role held by Mr D J Lewin, the
founder and major shareholder of the Company.  He holds regular
meetings with the non-executive directors without the presence of
other executives.
During the 52 week period to 29 July 2007, eight Board Meetings were
held.  Attendance by directors was as follows:
Director Attendance
D J Lewin 6
C S Lewin 8
B R Hartog 7
Mrs D M Darlington 6
(return from maternity leave)
S P Houlston 8
J S Robinson 8
M C Bugler 8
J F Coleman 8
R H Gunlack 8
B Jackson 8
Non-executive directors are appointed for a three year term when a
further term may be agreed.  These appointments can be terminated
at any time and with no notice. John Coleman and Robert Gunlack,
who have served on the Board for more than nine years, and Brian
Jackson have no other relationship with the Company and are
considered by the Board to be independent.  The non-executive
directors, who comprise approximately one third of the Board, are
considered to be of sufficient calibre and stature to carry significant
weight in the Board decisions.
Robert Gunlack acts as the senior non executive director. 
All directors are required to submit themselves for re-election at an
annual general meeting at least once every three years. Through
attendance at Board and Executive meetings as well as private
meetings, the Chairman continually evaluates the performance of
individual directors. The advice and services of the Company
Secretary is available to all directors.   Directors may also seek inde-
pendent professional advice in the furtherance of their duties at the
Company's expense.
BOARD COMMITTEES
There are three main committees of the Board:
a) Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the three non-executive directors
and is chaired by Robert Gunlack.  Mr Gunlack is a Chartered
Accountant with recent and relevant financial experience.  The
Committee has terms of reference setting out its duties and
procedures and these are available on request.  The Audit Committee
advises the Board on the appointment, re-appointment or removal of
the external auditors.  It also scrutinises and advises the Board on the
remuneration of the external auditors.  The Committee discusses the
nature and scope of the audit with the external auditors and provides
a forum for reporting by the Group's external auditors on any matters
it considers appropriate.  
It is the task of the Audit Committee to ensure that auditor objectiv-
ity and independence is safeguarded when non audit services are
provided by the auditors.  This is dealt with at each audit committee
meeting when the auditors set out the extent of the different work
they have undertaken, who in their firm was responsible and whether
the appointment was agreed in advance by the Committee or
requires ratification where engaged between meetings by the
executive directors.
The Committee monitors and reviews the Group's accounting
policies and financial reporting and the effectiveness of its risk
management and internal control procedures including internal audit
activities.
The Committee met twice during the period.  Mr Coleman and Mr
Jackson attended both meetings and Mr Gunlack attended one.
Corporate Governance Statement
22 CLINTON CARDS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS b) Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises the three non-executive
directors and executive director, Don Lewin, and is chaired by Brian
Jackson.  The full Nomination Committee met on eight occasions in
the financial period to monitor the performance of the executive
directors and review succession planning.
c) Remuneration Committee
The Board has considered and followed the best practise provisions
set out in schedules A and B of the Code dealing with performance
related pay and the remuneration report respectively.  The three non-
executive directors constitute the Remuneration Committee chaired
by John Coleman.  The full Committee met on three occasions during
the financial period.  The Committee was assisted in its deliberations
by the Chairman.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Company recognises the importance of communicating with
current and potential shareholders.  It does this through the Annual
Report and Financial Statements, the Interim Statement and any
trading updates.  This information is also available on the Company
website (www.clintoncards.co.uk). All directors are available at the
Annual General Meeting where shareholders can ask questions or
represent their views. Institutional investors and analysts often
request meetings with the Company offering an opportunity for
directors to explain the business and its aspirations.
As set out in the Notice of Meeting at the end of this report and
financial statements, each substantially separate issue proposed at
the Annual General Meeting has a separate resolution.  This in
particular relates to the Annual Report and Financial Statements and
the election or re-election of an individual director.
All proxy votes lodged by the deadline set out in the Notice of Meeting
are counted and made available at the Annual General Meeting.
The Company has now enabled certain shareholders holding shares
in uncertificated form in CREST to be able to appoint a proxy or
proxies using the CREST proxy voting service. The Board has now
extended the facility of electronic voting to all shareholders.
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
The Group is mindful that its employees, customers, suppliers and
shareholders all have an interest in how the Group recognises and
manages its corporate social responsibility.
The Corporate Social Responsibility Committee meets at least three
times a year to consider matters within its remit.  It is now consti-
tuted to deal with matters across the Group.  The Committee
comprises the Group Finance Director, the Group Health and Safety
Manager, the Group Human Resources Manager, the Store
Operations Managers of Clinton and Birthdays and the Group
Property Manager.
