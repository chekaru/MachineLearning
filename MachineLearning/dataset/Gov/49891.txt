 Principal risks
Our offerings transpire to be uncompetitive 
within the market or an unforeseen technology 
shift occurs where the market develops 
appetite for different equipment and solutions 
to those offered.
We potentially do not dedicate correct levels 
of resource to satisfy our customers' varying 
needs for innovation. 
Our growth aspirations are impacted by the 
economic climate and with a certain level of 
uncertainty about a full return to economic 
stability in the short-term; there is the  
potential for reduced capital expenditure  
from customers. 
There is an absence of appropriate investment 
into automated tools and other efficiency 
measures, which effectively fails to reduce  
the need for manual intervention activity  
or a suitable return on these investments  
is not realised. 
Following significant progress over the last 
years in freeing working capital through the 
disposal of the distribution business, as well  
as other working capital optimisation initiatives, 
a material increase in working capital demand 
could harm further progress in this regard. 
Our sales teams do not focus on our defined 
propositions and target market, resulting in 
 over-promising' on the scope of services 
offered to new customers or making 
non-standard offerings during the life of a 
contract, resulting in margin erosion, customer 
dissatisfaction or delays in the initial phases  
of the contract. 
Our vendor partners compete in the high-
end sales environment and approach our 
customers directly.
With a project of this scale, there is the 
potential that during early transition operational 
issues could occur which may impact on 
customer service levels and ultimately, overall 
financial performance of the Company. 
After the ERP system is embedded there 
is the potential that the full return on this 
investment is not realised. 
Principal mitigations
We formally review all lost bids and most 
won bids to ensure that we keep abreast of 
customer expectation from their IT services 
and solutions partner. We formally review our 
internal service providers against price points 
and benchmarked service quality standards.
We launched a Customer Value Scorecard 
to identify our larger customers' innovation 
needs and we are currently implementing the 
 continual improvement framework' to detect 
where innovation needs are arising. 
We operate within different economies that 
are affected differently at different times. We 
also believe that our offerings are targeted 
specifically towards being beneficial to our 
customers who are looking to reduce costs. 
The industrialisation and investment review 
board convenes monthly and monitors the 
return on investment as well as the planned 
KPI improvements.
There is continued focus on strict cost control 
and in future, the ERP system will facilitate 
a common approach to working capital 
management, across the Group, through  
best practice and other working capital  
control adoption. 
Governance boards and a tool through  
which all relevant parties have to engage,  
aim to prevent any non-standard offerings.  
All change management will be reviewed by 
a governance board and if material, the same 
approval process as for new contracts will  
be initiated.
Senior management work very closely with 
our leading vendor partners and customers  
in order to continually promote and protect the 
value we bring to the sale. Computacenter' s 
customers demand optimisation of their 
IT infrastructures and to this end, vendor 
independent solutions are imperative. 
The transition of the various systems have 
been phased over a period of circa three 
years, with the other countries providing 
back-up support to the transitioning country. 
Lessons learnt from the early 2011 transition 
in Germany will be deployed in the UK  
and France. 
Return on investment plans have been 
developed and will be built into the internal 
governance structure at all relevant levels  
and targets have already been added to 
senior management pay plans.

Computacenter' s Group Risk Department facilitates a process 
through which the Group' s most senior management team 
identify all the significant risks posed to the strategic goals. During 
2010, the Strategic Risk Profiling Project ( SRPP'), or  top-down' 
risk identification, was additionally facilitated by an external risk 
consultancy and the result of this exercise was adopted by the Board 
and shared with all the business unit leaders across the Group.
The annual  bottom-up' risk assessment process involves all 
business unit leaders across the Group, to identify and prioritise, in 
accordance with a pre-approved risk matrix of severity and likelihood 
values, those risks posed to the objectives and targets set for their 
individual business units. The output of this process presents a risk 
footprint for each business unit, as well as, a collated top risks log  
for the Group, which is compared to the SRPP log.
Safeguards already in place and further required mitigations for each 
identified risk are included in the risk logs, together with the owners 
of the risks. The frequencies for reviewing the effectiveness of the 
safeguards, as well as the date by which mitigation plans need to  
be progressed, are added to complete the risk plans.
The Group Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive, 
convenes quarterly to review progress against the risk plans. 
Additionally, the Committee considers any new risks of potential 
significance which may be added to the appropriate risk log and  
for which a risk plan is required.
