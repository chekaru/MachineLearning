Notes to the Accounts 
Pension commitments
The Group operates several pension schemes, the major one being of the funded defined benefit type. 
This scheme was closed to new entrants on 25 July 2000 and replaced by a defined contribution scheme. 
The assets of the defined benefit schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting 
Practice 24 (SSAP24) and the disclosures given in a) below are those required by that accounting standard.
A new pension cost accounting standard - Financial Reporting Standard 17 (FRS17) was issued in November
2000. The mandatory full implementation of this FRS has now been deferred. Prior to this, transitional
disclosure rules apply and these additional disclosures are set out in b) below.
a) SSAP24 Pension Costs
Contributions to the main scheme are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of 
pensions over employees' working lives with the Group. Contributions are determined by a qualified actuary 
on the basis of the triennial valuations.
The latest actuarial valuation of the main scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2001. The valuation
employed the projected unit method of valuation for liabilities. As a result of the main scheme being closed 
to new entrants from 25 July 2000, other things being equal, over the long term, this is expected to lead 
to a gradual increase in the age profile and hence contribution rate. However, this increasing contribution rate 
will be applied to a gradually reducing pensionable salary roll as people retire or cease membership.
The scheme's assets were valued using a market based valuation approach.
The main long-term assumptions adopted for the purpose of deriving the pension costs in these accounts were 
that the investment return would be 7 .25% per annum (pre-retirement) and 5.50% per annum (post-retirement);
that basic salaries for pension calculation purposes would be frozen for 3 years until April 2005 and would then
increase in line with price inflation, assumed to be 2.5% per annum, and that the lower earnings limit offset
would increase by 2.5% per annum. Present and future pensions have been assumed to increase at the rate 
of 5% per annum (pre April 1994 accrual) and by 2.5% per annum (post April 1994 accrual; non GMP
element only).
At the start of this financial year, the market value of the assets was  21.6m and, using the assumptions noted
above, this was sufficient to cover 79% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for 
expected future increases in earnings. 
As at 31 December 2001 the funding level as calculated under the prescribed assumptions of the Minimum
Funding Requirement (MFR) of the Pensions Act 1995 was 85%.
The actuarial deficit disclosed by the 2001 valuation will be spread over the average remaining working life 
of the membership (12 years). 
A decision regarding the final contribution rate is yet to be agreed between the Group and Trustees, however,
pending the agreement of a new rate, the Company has agreed to pay contributions at the rate of 10% of
pensionable salaries plus  818,000 per annum from 1 February 2002, subject to an annual funding review 
by the actuary. This rate was certified by the scheme actuary.
The pension cost, derived under SSAP24, in respect of the main scheme charged in these accounts was
 1,144,000, (2001:  816,000). This includes an additional charge of  649,00 (2001:  186,000) in respect of 
the amortisation of the balance sheet provision and scheme shortfall existing at the start of the financial year.
An amount of  165,000 (2001:  216,000) is included in provisions for liabilities and charges, this being the
excess of the accumulated pension cost charged against profit over the amount paid to the scheme.
