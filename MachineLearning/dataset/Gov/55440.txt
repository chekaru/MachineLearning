(i) No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of certain overseas tax losses as there is insufficient certainty that these losses will
be utilised within the immediate future.
(ii) No deferred tax has been provided on revalued assets due to the availability of realised capital losses for which no deferred tax asset
has been recognised.
(iii) There are additional unprovided capital losses carried forward which have not yet been agreed with the Inland Revenue.
(iv) The Group is able to obtain tax relief in some overseas territories for the cost of goodwill arising on its acquisitions of some businesses. 
In certain cases the goodwill was written off to reserves under the transitional rules set out in FRS 10. Utilisation of the available tax relief in the
overseas territories gives rise to a timing difference as set out above. The potential timing differences will only reverse on sale of the relevant
businesses. As the relevant businesses are considered core to the Group there is currently no intention to dispose of them. The potential reversal
is so far into the future that after discounting, the potential liability becomes insignificant. The effect of discounting the Group's accelerated
capital allowances is a credit of  3.6 million (2001 as re-analysed  2.4 million). The effect of discounting the Group's other deferred tax assets
and liabilities is not material.

(vi) Options granted in June, July and December 1997 at respective prices of  4.070625,  4.30 and  4.7375 per share are now exercisable
as both performance criteria have been met. On 31st October, 2001, the TSR condition was also met in respect of the options granted in
December 1998 at  6.475 per share, but since real growth in adjusted earnings per share was not achieved in the prior year, nor in the year
ended 29th September, 2002, compared to that of three years previously, there will be a further minimum delay of approximately one year
before those options become exercisable. As a consequence, 195,368 of such options lapsed in the year.
Neither of the performance conditions has been met yet in respect of the options granted in December 1999 at  10.295 per share and in June
2000 at  10.96 per share. Accordingly, there will also be a minimum delay of approximately one year before those options become exercisable.
As a consequence, 96,000 options, granted at  10.295 per share, will lapse in the year to 28th September, 2003.

(i) The transfer from the revaluation reserve recognises the progressive realisation of a previously unrealised gain on disposal of businesses
to GWR Group plc as the goodwill on the interest in GWR is amortised.
(ii) At 29th September, 2002, cumulative goodwill of continuing businesses of  688.9 million (2001  688.4 million) had been written off against
the profit and loss account.

(iv) These options were granted at market value at the date of grant and none required any payment. They are not normally exercisable before
the third anniversary of the date of grant and in all circumstances will lapse if not exercised within ten years.
(v) In the case of the 1997 Executive Share Option Scheme, they are normally exercisable only when the relevant performance conditions
have been met. The first condition is that, in respect of four out of six consecutive monthly calculation dates (which start in the thirtieth month
following the date of grant of a particular option), the total shareholder return ( TSR') of the Company must exceed that of the FTSE 100 index.
Secondly, there must be real growth in earnings per share over a period of three consecutive financial years.
