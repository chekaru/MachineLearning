Corporate responsibility
Our approach to corporate 
responsibility
We take seriously our responsibility to 
manage the business in an ethical and 
sustainable way for the benefit of the 
business and all our stakeholders.
We have:
   Maintained our membership of the 
FTSE4Good Index which identifies 
companies that meet recognised 
standards of corporate responsibility
   Supported the Institute of Business Ethics 
(IBE) which was founded to encourage 
high standards in ethical behaviour and is 
supported by donations from companies 
and individuals. Through our donation we 
help to promote ethical business practice 
and add to the work of the IBE through 
the sharing of good practice and their 
experience of ethical issues
   Continued to report our greenhouse 
gas emissions to the Carbon Disclosure 
Project
We are always keen to improve our 
practices and during the year an 
independent third party was commissioned 
to conduct a corporate responsibility audit 
to review how we compare to current 
best practice. We will be using the results 
as a gap analysis to inform our corporate 
responsibility focus during 2013/14; our 
initial focus will be on improving internal 
and external communication of our wide 
range of corporate responsibility activities 
to improve awareness and understanding 
and promote employee engagement.
Accountability and management 
processes
The Board is ultimately responsible 
for assessing the impact of corporate 
responsibility issues on the Group' s business 
and for setting appropriate policies. During 
the year a new Ethics Committee was 
formed made up entirely of Non-executive 
Directors. This Committee is responsible 
for advising the Board on the development 
of strategy and policy on ethical matters. 
Further details about the Ethics Committee 
can be found on page 45. 
The Chief Executive is the Board member 
with designated responsibility for corporate 
responsibility supported by: 
  The Executive Committee 
   The Risk Committee, which discusses 
corporate responsibility at its meetings 
in the context of monitoring the 
effectiveness of internal control systems 
   The Health, Safety and Environment 
Committee, whose responsibilities 
include making recommendations on 
health, safety and environmental strategy 
and identifying areas for improvement
Ethical framework
Code of Business Principles 
All employees are required to follow 
the Code of Business Principles (CBP) 
approved by the Board when performing 
their duties as employees. Employees and 
business partners worldwide must follow 
this CBP when they are representing  
the Group.
Areas covered by the CBP , which is 
available on our website, are shown in  
the ethical framework diagram on page 32. 
The CBP is a key part of the new employee 
induction process worldwide and refresher 
training was given at a number of internal 
conferences and departmental meetings 
during 2012/13. This will be extended 
during 2013/14 to ensure that the 
messages are being delivered consistently 
across the business. Ethics champions  
will also be appointed across the Group  
to provide a point of contact and focus  
in the sites. 
Whistleblowing
The Group's whistleblowing procedures 
enable employees who have concerns 
about the application of the CBP or 
business practices within the Group to raise 
them internally or anonymously through an 
independently run telephone helpline, the 
De La Rue CodeLine. The Board and Audit 
Committee receive details about any issue 
raised and how it has been followed up. 
Each year the Audit Committee reviews  
the policy and procedures. 
Third party partners
The Group third party partner (TPP) 
team continues to develop and refine 
the processes and procedures for the 
appointment and reappointment of 
distributors, sales agents and consultants. 
These processes are subject to audit and 
external verification. All applications for 
appointment, reappointment and renewal 
of TPPs are managed by this central 
team which reports directly to the General 
Counsel and Company Secretary. 
All TPPs:
   Are subject to an appropriate level  
of due diligence
   Receive training on the CBP and the 
standards of ethical behaviour expected 
by De La Rue 
   Receive training covering anti bribery 
and corruption, competition law and TPP 
policy. More than 75 per cent of partners 
receive this training online, with the 
remainder receiving one to one training 
Relevant employees also participate  
in online training which covers working  
with TPPs.
We recognise that good 
corporate responsibility practices 
are key to our business success. 
We work within a robust ethical 
framework and strive to ensure 
the health and safety of our 
employees, minimise our impact 
on the environment and play a 
positive role in the communities 
in which we operate. 
Celebrating 300 years of papermaking
As part of our celebrations of 300 years of 
papermaking a  Design a banknote' competition 
was held in schools local to our Overton mill site 
(see winning entry pictured above). The winners 
visited our design team and were presented with 
a professionally produced version of their design. 
Other activities to mark the tercentenary included 
a customer seminar covering a wide range of 
banknote related topics and employee events. 32 De La Rue Annual Report 2013

Health and safety 
We have a responsibility to safeguard 
the health and safety of all stakeholders 
affected by our operations and keeping 
employees safe and secure when they  
are at work and travelling on business  
is a priority. Clearly defined responsibilities, 
good communication and training, 
hazard spotting, risk assessments and 
implementing appropriate controls at  
all facilities help us to achieve this.
All of our supply chain manufacturing  
sites have maintained OHSAS18001:2007 
certification for their health and safety 
management systems, which is externally 
audited by accredited providers. 
During the year no De La Rue operation 
has been prosecuted for infringing any 
health and safety laws or regulations.
The Executive Committee and the Board 
receive confirmation that the business units 
and functions comply with Group policy and 
applicable laws through external and internal 
audits on their management systems, 
reports and measurement against action 
plans. These reports are used to develop 
effective improvement programmes. 
De La Rue works with its main suppliers 
and contractors to ensure their health 
and safety processes are robust. This 
year, in response to the many changes 
and upgrades at our sites, including the 
relocation of holographic and security 
printing operations and the installation of 
many new machines, we have continued 
to put a strong focus on our machinery 
safety standards and on managing our 
contractors. We have continued to improve 
our fire risk management controls with 
several sites upgrading sprinkler systems. 
Our health and safety KPIs are shown 
opposite. Disappointingly, the number 
of lost time accidents and the total days 
lost due to accidental injuries have both 
increased slightly this year with lost days 
exceeding our target by 17 per cent and 
injuries by 12 per cent. These results are 
attributable in large part to structural and 
organisational changes in our business. 
With more organisational changes in the 
short term, we expect that the coming year 
will be challenging as we drive to retain 
our strong safety culture, excellent internal 
reporting processes and engage employees 
in our safety programmes. We will continue 
to set robust health and safety targets. 
Liverpool Football Club Community 
Coaching Team visit Malta
In April 2012 the Liverpool Football Club 
Community Coaching Team visited Malta  
to deliver a variety of community activities.  
A De La Rue Malta employee helped to facilitate 
the visit and the site supported this initiative 
by providing footballs and all the equipment 
required to hold a training session for children 
with additional needs. We also supported 
school visits in Rabat and Bir   zebbu   ga which 
included disability awareness sessions and 
 Truth for Youth' assemblies, promoting hard 
hitting social messages. All children participating 
in these events were presented with gifts to 
commemorate the event, funded by De La Rue.
