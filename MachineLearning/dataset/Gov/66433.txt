 DIRECTORS' STATEMENT ON CORPORATE
GOVERNANCE
EIDOS
Overview
The Board is committed to
establishing and maintaining high
standards of corporate governance
- the process by which the Group
is directed and managed, risks are
identified and controlled and
effective accountability assured.
To that end, the Board was further
strengthened during the period
under review by the appointment
of two additional independent
non-executive directors, namely,
John van Kuffeler (Chairman) and
David Adams, and the
appointment of Stuart
Cruickshank as Group Finance
Director. Together with other
changes made to the senior
management team and reporting
structure to improve day-to-day
operating efficiency, these
appointments (and the experience
which comes with them) should
provide the opportunity for the
Group to further enhance its
corporate governance approach.
This statement is intended to
describe how the Group has applied
the Principles of the Combined
Code on Corporate Governance
(the Code ). It also highlights key
changes and progress made since
the last statement and explains the
areas of non-compliance and how
these have been or will be
addressed in the future.
The Board
The Board meets on a monthly
basis throughout the year and,
commencing in 2003, will also
meet annually to review and
approve long-term strategy.
During the early part of the
period, the Board comprised two
non-executive and four executive
directors although this increased
to four non-executives and five
executive directors by the period
end, following the appointments
referred to above. The new balance
of the Board, and its Committee, is
now in keeping with the Code's
recommendations. Biographical
details of the directors and their
standing committee memberships
are shown on page 6.
The offices of Chairman and Chief
Executive are held separately with
a clear division of responsibility
between them. Prior to the
appointment of John van Kuffeler
as Chairman on 18 April 2002, Ian
Livingstone held that office. He
stepped down to focus his
attention on his new appointment
as Creative Director.
All the non-executive directors are
considered to be independent (as
defined in the Code) and together
they bring a wide range of skills
and international experience to
issues brought before the Board.
This helps to ensure that
independent judgement is
exercised and that a proper
balance of power is maintained for
full and effective control.
Consequently, the Board does not
believe it necessary to identify a
senior independent director
separate to that of the Chairman
but proposes to keep the situation
under review.
All directors are required to stand
for re-election at least every three
years. They have access to the
advice and services of the
Company Secretary and, if
necessary, access to further
independent advice at the
Company's expense in accordance
with an approved procedure.
A Board and Executive Manual
(which is subject to annual review)
sets out the duties, responsibilities
and authorities of the directors, a
schedule of matters specifically
reserved for the Board's decision
and, in relation to non-reserved
matters, the terms of reference
under which the Board has
devolved responsibility to the
following standing committees:
Audit Committee
Chairman, Victor Steel
This Committee now comprises
three non-executive directors (two
until 9 May 2001) and meets no
less than three times a year with
the external auditors together
with various representatives of the
executive, finance and internal
audit functions in attendance. It
also meets with the external
auditors in private after each
meeting.
The Committee reviews the
interim and full-year results
before presentation to the Board,
the findings of the internal and
external auditors and the Group's
internal control systems and
financial accounting policies and
procedures. It also advises the
Board on the appointment of
external auditors and on the
scope, results and cost
effectiveness of both the audit
and non-audit work. (Details of
the auditors' remuneration
appears in note 6 to the
accounts).
Remuneration Committee
Chairman, Allen Thomas
This Committee, which now
comprises four non-executive
directors (two until 9 May 2001),
meets at least once a year and
otherwise as necessary. It advises
the Board on the Company's
remuneration policy and
determines, on behalf of the
Board, the individual remuneration
packages of the executive directors
and certain members of senior
management. Further details
about the Committee are included
in the Report on Directors'
Remuneration on pages 8 to 11.
No director is involved in
determining his own
remuneration, whether determined
by the Committee, or in the case
of non-executives, by the Board.
John van Kuffeler is a Committee
member who will stand for re-
election as director at the
Company's forthcoming Annual
General Meeting.
Nomination Committee
Chairman, John van Kuffeler
This Committee comprises all the
non-executive directors and the
Chief Executive and meets at least
once a year. It is responsible for
reviewing the composition and
structure of the Board and for
making recommendations for new
appointments to the Board for
approval.
Development Committee
Chairman, Michael McGarvey
The Development Committee
comprises senior representatives of
the Group's main development
businesses in addition to key
commercial staff and meets every
two weeks to review the progress
of existing projects in
development and to consider new
projects for future development. It
is also responsible for reviewing
the Group's development strategy
and for making recommendations
to the Board as appropriate.
Over the course of the period the
Development Committee has
become the primary source of
control over the Group's
development business and it has
become a key element of the
Group's overall control
environment.
Publishing Committee
Chairman, Michael McGarvey
The Publishing Committee
comprises the Managing Directors
and senior sales and marketing
staff from the Group's territory
offices. It meets quarterly to
review products due for
forthcoming release and to
formulate product specific sales
and marketing plans. It is also
responsible for reviewing the
Group's wider sales and marketing
strategies and for making
recommendations to the Chief
Executive Officer as appropriate.
The Publishing Committee remains
a key element of the Group's
overall control environment.
Relations with Shareholders
The Board attaches considerable
importance to its relationship and
communication with shareholders.
The executive directors meet
regularly with institutional
shareholders, both in the UK and
overseas, in order to maintain a
valuable dialogue with them within
the parameters of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000.
Communication is facilitated by 
full year and interim reports issued
to shareholders which, together
with other corporate information
and press releases, are available on
the Company's web-site:
www.eidos.com
The Annual General Meeting
provides a forum for private
shareholders to raise issues with
the directors. The Notice
convening the Meeting is 
normally issued at least 20
working days in advance and
separate resolutions are proposed
on each substantially separate
issue. Going forward, and in line
with best practice, a summary of
the Meeting's proceedings,
together with the level of proxy
votes lodged on each resolution,
will be made available to
shareholders on request.
Internal Controls
The directors are ultimately
responsible for the good standing
of the Company, the management
of assets for optimum
performance and for operating an
effective system of internal
controls appropriate to the
business. However, it must be
recognised that any system can
only provide reasonable and not
absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss.

Internal control process
Day-to-day operating and
financial responsibility rests with
senior management at territory
head and operating unit level,
although their performance is
closely monitored by the full
Board.
The following key elements
comprise the existing internal
control process:
  an organisation structure with
clear operating procedures,
lines of responsibility and
delegated levels of authority;
  a comprehensive financial
control, budgeting and rolling
forecast system, including on-
going monitoring and
compliance;
  an appropriate internal audit
function (which is subject to
annual review);
  a flat management structure
which facilitates open and
timely communication; and
  an experienced legal function
that supports the Group's
business needs, particularly
from an intellectual property
protection and exploitation
perspective.
Significant improvements made
during the period
In addition to operating the
existing internal control process,
significant improvements were
made during the period through
the following key actions:
  the change in the Company's
accounting reference period
from 31 March to 30 June will
help to reduce the previous
uncertainty surrounding full
year forecasting in what is in
part a seasonally driven market
place;
  the successful completion of a
cost reduction programme has
better aligned the cost
structure with the current and
expected future needs of the
business;
  the introduction of an annual
sign-off procedure from
operating unit management
has provided comfort as
regards their compliance with
the Group's Procedure and
Operating Manual and the local
system of internal controls
which are in place; and
  the completion of a preliminary
internal control review and the
subsequent creation of a Risk
Management Committee will
help to further improve the
Company's risk management
process with a view to it
becoming embedded in the
business by the end of 2003.
The Committee, which
comprises certain executive
directors and members of
senior management, reports
directly into the Audit
Committee. The aim is ensure
that all risks, particularly those
of a significant corporate
nature, are properly identified,
evaluated and managed at
appropriate levels in the
organisation in a proactive and
timely manner.
Further improvements will
continue to be made during the
current financial year.
The Board, assisted by the Audit
Committee, has reviewed the
effectiveness of the system of
internal controls in place for the
period under review, taking
account of any material
developments since that date,
using the process set out above.
Compliance status
The Boards considers that
throughout the period under
review the Company has complied
with the requirements of the Code,
save as disclosed above and, in
relation to the absence of pre-
exercise performance conditions
attaching to discretionary share
option awards, as disclosed in the
Report on Directors  Remuneration
on pages 8 to 11.
