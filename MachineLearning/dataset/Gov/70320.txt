Under IAS 36 the Group tests for impairment of goodwill and indefinite 
life intangible assets annually.  In addition the Group has tested 
other assets where there is an indication of impairment.  The Group 
has classified each property as an individual CGU.  The recoverable 
amount of each CGU is calculated from discounted cashflow 
projections of the future performance of each property. The key 
assumptions are those regarding forecast profit, discount rates and 
growth rates for each CGU as follows:
Forecast profit is initially derived from 5 year average historical 
profit, taking into account the most recent budget as appropriate. 
Yearly growth rates in the 9 years subsequent to these forecasts, of 
between 5% and 10% dependent on maturity of revenue stream 
 
 
 
 
 
Group pre-tax interest rate of 10% used as the discount factor 
Full allocation of overheads by property 
Where a CGU was found to be impaired based on the assumptions 
above, a charge was made to bring their carrying value in line with the 
value calculated.
On 31 October ER acquired worldwide in perpetuity audio visual, 
licensing and merchandising, publishing, live events and new media 
rights to Rupert Bear for  6 million.  Consideration of  3 million was 
paid on completion with the balance payable in 2 instalments no 
later than 15 January 2007.  Express  Newspapers retains a minority 
interest in Rupert Bear of 33.33% plus the right to publish Rupert Bear 
comic strips in certain Express publications.
Amortisation and impairment charge
The amortisation and impairment charge are recognised in cost of 
sales.  During 2004 and 2005, based on recent performance and 
management's revised expectations an impairment requirement was 
identified and charged.

Tell-Tale made a loss of  1.1 million for the period 1 January 2004 to 9 September 2004.
The fair value of the net assets acquired has been revised from  (2.6) million to  1.0 million, including a  2.4 million adjustment for alignment of 
accounting policies and  1.2 million of fair value adjustments. Accounting policy changes include the capitalisation of programme development 
costs, associated amortisation and recognition of revenue in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. Fair value adjustments include 
the recognition of intangible assets, the write-down of tangible assets, the recognition of deferred tax assets and a provision for an onerous 
lease contract.
During August 2005 a review of the fair values of the Tell-Tale properties was carried out. Based on revised discounted cashflows, investment in 
programmes was reduced by an amount of  1.8m, copyright increased by  1.5m and accruals decreased by  0.3m due to a revision of budgeted 
costs in programmes in development.
