Liquidity risk
The Group manages its cash and borrowings requirements centrally to minimise net interest expense within risk
parameters agreed by the Board whilst ensuring the Group has sufficient liquid resources to meet the operating needs of
its business. The forecast cash and borrowings profile of the Group is monitored to ensure that adequate headroom
remains under committed borrowing facilities.
The following table analyses the Group's non-derivative financial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities into relevant
maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date. It excludes
trade and other payables due to the low associated liquidity risk. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual
cash flows and such may differ from the amounts disclosed on the balance sheet.

Market risk
The Group's activities expose it primarily to the financial risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest
rates. The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and
foreign currency risk, including:
a) forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk on the purchase of inventory in  
US Dollars;
b) interest rate swap to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates; and
c) borrowings denominated in the currency of the principal assets and cash flows.These are primarily 
denominated in US Dollars, Euros and Sterling.
Credit risk
Credit risk relates to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to
the Group. Investment of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative instruments are made through banks which must
fulfil credit rating investment criteria approved by the Board.
All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. Receivable balances are
monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made for estimated irrecoverable amounts. The concentration of credit
risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Details of the Group's outstanding receivables balances are detailed in note 18.
Capital risk
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt as analysed in notes 21 and 22, cash and cash equivalents in note 20
and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent company, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings
as disclosed in notes 26 and 28.The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities within the Group will be able to
continue as going concerns while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity
balance.The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Sensitivity Analysis
The exposure to the Moroccan Dirham is not considered a significant risk due to the close correlation between it and
the Euro providing a pseudo hedge.

Foreign Currency
The Group's principal foreign currency exposures are to the US Dollars and Euros. The table below illustrates  the
hypothetical sensitivity of the Group's reported profits and equity to a 10% increase and decrease in the US Dollar/
Sterling and Euro / Sterling exchange rates at the year end date assuming all other variables remain unchanged.
The sensitivity rate of 10% represents the Directors' assessment of a reasonable possible change. The analysis assumes
that exchange rate fluctuations on currency derivatives that form part of an effective cash flow hedge relationship affect
the fair value in equity and the fair value of the hedging derivatives. For foreign exchange derivatives which are not
designated hedges, movements in exchange rates impact on the income statement.
Year end exchange rates applied in the analysis below are US Dollar 1.44 (2008: 1.99) and Euro 1.12 (2008: 1.34).
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity.

Interest rate 
The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Group's reported profit to a 0.5% increase or decrease in
interest rates, assuming all other variables were unchanged. The sensitivity rate of 0.5% represents the Directors
assessment of a reasonable possible change.
The analysis has been prepared using the assumption that for floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of the asset or
liability outstanding at the balance sheet date has been outstanding for the whole year and for fixed rate financial
instruments that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate at risk for the purpose of this analysis.
Positive figures represents an increase in profit.

Corporate Governance 
The Group manages its affairs in accordance with the principles of Corporate Governance contained in the Combined
Code on Corporate Governance (Combined Code ) issued by the Financial Services Authority in July 2003 and
updated in June 2006.
This statement describes how the principles of Good Governance have been applied to the Group, including both the
main Principles and the Supporting Principles as described in section 1 of the Combined Code. This should be read in
conjunction with the Report on the Directors' Remuneration, which covers the Principles on Directors' Remuneration.
The Group has complied with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code throughout the year except
where indicated below.
Directors
The Board currently comprises three Executive and two Non-Executive Directors, which does not comply with Code
provision A.3.2 which requires at least two independent Non-Executive Directors, excluding the Chairman. Their
details, including information on their backgrounds are set out on page 17. The Board has a wide range of experience
and in the case of the Non-Executive Directors, independence which is invaluable in the Board's deliberations. Mr C A
Marsh resigned as Non-Executive Chairman on 18 September 2008. Mr A E Watson was appointed as Non-Executive
Chairman on 23 September 2008; he brings a wealth of relevant commercial experience and skills to the Alexandra
Board which are closely aligned with the future needs of the business. Mr P M Rosser was appointed as Director of
Corporate Operations on 23 September 2008. The Directors consider that the current size of the Board is
appropriate for the requirements of the business and intend to take steps to maintain this balance following the
forthcoming changes to the Board noted in the Chairman's Statement and Directors' Report. Details of the Directors'
service contracts can be found on page 62.
Ms E New was appointed on 19 April 2006 and the Board has concluded that she is independent on the basis of
the criteria specified in paragraph A.3.1 of the Combined Code. Ms E New is the Senior Independent Director.
There is a clear delineation of responsibility between the Chairman, Chief Executive and the other Directors. The
Chairman is responsible for the effective running of the Board whilst the Chief Executive is responsible for operating
the business and implementing the Board's strategies and policies.
Directors have the right to seek independent professional advice in the furtherance of their duties at the Company's
expense. In addition, all the Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary who is
responsible to the Board for ensuring agreed procedures, rules and regulations are followed.
The business of the Group is managed by the Board of Directors, which met formally thirteen times during the year.
All serving Directors attended all meetings with the exception of Mr Marsh who did not attend two meetings in April
2008. The meetings follow a formal agenda covering matters specifically reserved for decision by the Board. These
include key areas of the Group's affairs such as overall strategy, organisational and compliance issues, acquisition policy,
approval of annual and interim results and budgets, major capital expenditure programmes and financing issues. The
Board also reviews trading performance and receives regular reports and presentations on all aspects of the business.
To enable the Board to discharge its duties, all Directors receive appropriate and timely information. Briefing papers are
distributed by the Company Secretary to all Directors in advance of the Board meetings. In addition, there is frequent
contact between meetings to progress the Group's business.
The Executive management team have the responsibility of implementing the strategies and policies determined by the
Board and monitoring the operational and financial performance of the business against budgets and forecasts.
During the year there were no formal performance evaluations of the Board and its Committees, as required by code
provision A6. However, the contribution by the Directors to the Board and its Committees was reviewed informally.
In accordance with the Company's Articles of Association, one third of the Directors submit themselves for re-election
each year at the Annual General Meeting so that each Director seeks re-election at least triennially. New Directors
appointed during the year seek re-appointment at the next Annual General Meeting.
Board Committees
The Board has appointed two formal committees: the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee, each of
which operate within clearly defined terms of reference.
