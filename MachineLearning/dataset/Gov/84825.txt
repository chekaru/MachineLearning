principles of Good Governance set out in the Combined Code in relation to the size and the stage of development of the Company.

Directors are of the opinion that the Board comprises a suitable balance and that the recommendations of the Combined Code have been
implemented to an appropriate level.  The Board, through the Chairman, the Managing Director and the Non-executive Director, maintains regular
contact with its advisers and public relations consultants in order to ensure that the Board develops an understanding of the views of major
shareholders about the Company.
Board Meetings
The Board meets regularly throughout the year.  For the period ending 30 June 2008 the Board met four times in relation to normal operational

increased activity and further development of the Company, continuing reviews of internal controls will be undertaken to ensure that they are
adequate and effective.

Risk Management
The Board considers risk assessment to be important in achieving its strategic objectives.  There is a process of evaluation of performance
targets through regular reviews by senior management to forecasts.  Project milestones and timelines are regularly reviewed.
Risks and uncertainties
The principal risks facing the Company are set out below.  Risk assessment and evaluation is an essential part of the Group's planning and an
important aspect of the Group's internal control system.
General and economic risks
 contractions in the world's major economies or increases in the rate of inflation resulting from international conditions;
 movements in the equity and share markets in the United Kingdom and throughout the world;
 weakness in global equity and share markets in particular, in the United Kingdom, and adverse changes in market sentiment towards 
the resource industry;
 currency exchange rate fluctuations and, in particular, the relative prices of Australian Dollar, and the UK Pound;
 exposure to interest rate fluctuations; and
 adverse changes in factors affecting the success of exploration and development operations, such as increases in expenses, changes 
in government policy and further regulation of the industry; unforeseen major failure, breakdowns or repairs required to key items of 
plant and equipment resulting in significant delays, notwithstanding regular programmes of repair, maintenance and upkeep; variations 
in grades and unforeseen adverse geological factors or prolonged weather conditions.
Funding risk
The Group or the companies in which it has invested may not be able to raise, either by debt or further equity, sufficient funds to enable
completion of planned exploration, investment and/or development projects.
Commodity risk
Commodities are subject to high levels of volatility in price and demand.  The price of commodities depends on a wide range of factors, most
of which are outside the control of the Company.  Mining, processing and transportation costs also depend on many factors, including
commodity prices, capital and operating costs in relation to any operational site.
Exploration and development risks
 Exploration and development activity is subject to numerous risks, including failure to achieve estimated mineral resource, recovery 
and production rates and capital and operating costs.
 Success in identifying economically recoverable reserves can never be guaranteed.  The Company also cannot guarantee that the 
companies in which it has invested will be able to obtain the necessary permits and approvals required for development of their 
projects.
 Some of the countries in which the Company operates have native title laws which could affect exploration and development activities.
The companies in which the Company has an interest may be required to undertake clean-up programmes on any contamination from 
their operations or to participate in site rehabilitation programmes which may vary from country to country.  The Group's policy is to 
follow all applicable laws and regulations and the Company is not currently aware of any material issues in this regard.
 Timely approval of mining permits and operating plans through the respective regulatory agencies cannot be guaranteed. 
 Availability of skilled workers is an ongoing challenge.
 Geology is always a potential risk in mining activities. Market risk
The ability of the Group (and the companies it invests in) to continue to secure sufficient and profitable sales contracts to support its operations
is a key business risk.
Insurance
The Group maintains insurance in respect of its Directors and Officers against liabilities in relation to the Company. 
Treasury Policy
The Group finances its operations through equity and holds its cash as a liquid resource to fund the obligations of the Group.  Decisions
regarding the management of these assets are approved by the Board.
Securities Trading
The Board has adopted a Share Dealing Code that applies to Director, senior management and any employee who is in possession of 'inside
information'.  All such persons are prohibited from trading in the Company's securities if they are in possession of 'inside information'.  Subject
to this condition and trading prohibitions applying to certain periods, trading can occur provided the relevant individual has received the
appropriate prescribed clearance.
Relations with Shareholders
The Board is committed to providing effective communication with the shareholders of the Company.  Significant developments are disseminated
through stock exchange announcements and regular updates of the Company website.  The Board views the AGM as a forum for
communication between the Company and its shareholders and encourages their participation in its agenda.
