No other Directors have been granted share options in the shares of the Group or other Group entities. None of the terms and 
conditions of the share options were varied during the year.  The options granted under the Performance Related Scheme are subject 
to certain performance criteria, including compounded earnings per share growth of 3% plus the retail price index. The performance 
criteria associated with this scheme were chosen to incentivise the maximisation of shareholders' return. If unforeseen circumstances 
cause the Remuneration Committee to consider that the performance criteria have become unfair or impractical in the circumstances, 
they may, at their discretion amend the performance criteria.  
The options are granted at the prevailing market price, calculated as the average of the previous five days mid closing price, at the time 
of the grant in accordance with the rules of the scheme. There was nil cost to the directors at the date of grant. The market price of 
the Group shares at the end of the financial year was 63p. The range of market prices during the year was between 32p and 65p. 
No Directors have received options since 27 May 2008.  32 / HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2011

Share Option Schemes (audited)
At 31 January 2011, the following options to subscribe for ordinary shares have been granted to certain employees (including 
Directors) under the terms of the Share Option Schemes:
The Harvey Nash Group plc Performance Related Share Schemes
The Performance Related Schemes are administered by the Board under the supervision of the Remuneration Committee. The schemes 
are open to all full time employees except those who have had a material interest in the Group within the previous 12 months. The 
options granted under the Performance Related Scheme are subject to certain performance criteria, including compounded earnings 
per share growth of 3% plus the retail price index. The performance criteria associated with this scheme were chosen to incentivise 
the maximisation of shareholders' return.  . If unforeseen circumstances cause the Remuneration Committee to consider that the 
performance criteria have become unfair or impractical in the circumstances, they may, at their discretion amend the performance 
criteria.  
The schemes' exercise price is determined by the Board but will not be less than the average share price for the five days immediately 
preceding the grant of options. The Harvey Nash Group plc Performance Related Share Plan is an HMRC Approved Scheme, but the 
Board is able to grant unapproved options under the scheme. For schemes from July 2000 the Group has obtained agreement from 
the employee that he or she will settle the employer's national insurance charge in respect of any gain arising on eventual exercise. All 
options are granted for nil consideration. HARVEY NASH GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2011 / 33

Statement of directors' responsibilities in respect of the Annual Report 
for the year ended 31 January 2011
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors' Remuneration Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have prepared 
the group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union, and the parent company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law).  In preparing the group financial statements, the directors have also 
elected to comply with IFRSs, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Under company law the directors must 
not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and 
the company and of the profit or loss of the company and group for that period.  In preparing these financial statements, the directors 
are required to:
 	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 	 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 	 state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and IFRSs issued by IASB and applicable UK Accounting Standards have 
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the group and parent company financial statements 
respectively; and
 	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue 
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company's 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and the group and enable them 
to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors' Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards 
the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company 
and the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the company's website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.  
 
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed on page 1 confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
 	 the group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the group; and
 	 the Directors' Report on pages 9 - 13 and the Chairman's Statement, Operational Review and Financial Review  contained on pages 
3 - 8 includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the group, together with a 
description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.
In accordance with Section 418, in the case of each director in office at the date the directors' report is approved, that:
(a) so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company's auditors are unaware; and
(b) he has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the company's auditors are aware of that information.
On behalf of the Board
