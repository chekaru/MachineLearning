The Board takes responsibility for 
establishing and maintaining reliable 
systems of control in all areas of operation. 
These systems of control, especially 
of financial control, can only provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. 
The key matters relating to the system of 
internal control are set out below:
 	 I D O X	p l c	h a s	e s t a b li s h e d	a n	o p e ra t i o n a l	
management structure with clearly 
defined responsibilities and regular 
performance reviews
 	 t h e	G r o u p	o p e ra t e s	a	c o m p r e h e n s i v e	
system for reporting financial and 
non-financial information to the Board 
including preparation and review of 
strategy plans and the preparation and 
review of annual budgets
 	 fi n a n c i a l	r e s u l t s	a r e	m o n i t o r e d	
against budgets, forecasts and other 
performance indicators with action 
dictated accordingly at each meeting
 	 a	s t r u c t u r e d	a p p r o v a l	p r o c e s s	b a s e d	o n	
assessment of risk and value delivered
 	 s u f fi c i e n t	r e s o u r c e	i s	f o c u s e d	t o	
maintain and develop internal control 
procedures and information systems, 
especially in financial management
The Board considers that there have been 
no substantial weaknesses in internal 
financial controls that have resulted in 
any material losses, contingencies or 
uncertainties which need to be disclosed in 
the accounts.
The Board has considered the need for 
an internal audit function and concluded 
that there is no current need for such a 
function within the Group. In the absence 
of a dedicated function, one member of 
staff has undergone internal audit training 
and ad hoc internal audit projects have 
been carried out cross-departmentally 
during the year. Furthermore, in 
compliance with the Group's quality 
standards, additional internal reviews are 
carried out. 
Following publication of Internal Control: 
Guidance for Directors on the Combined 
Code (the Turnbull Guidance ), the Board 
confirms that there is an ongoing process 
for identifying, evaluating and managing 
the significant risks faced by the Group, 
and that this process has been in place 
for the year under review and up to the 
date of approval of the Annual Report 
and Accounts. This process is regularly 
reviewed by the Board and is consistent 
with the Turnbull Guidance. 
S t a t e m e n t	o f	D i r e c t o r s '	r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s
The directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the directors 
have to prepare financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (IFRSs). The financial 
statements are required by law to give a 
true and fair view of the state of affairs of 
the group and parent company and of the 
profit or loss of the group for that period. 
In preparing these financial statements, 
the directors are required to:
 	 s e l e c t	s u i t a b l e	a c c o u n t i n g	p o li c i e s	a n d	
then apply them consistently
 	 m a k e	j u d g m e n t s	a n d	e s t i m a t e s	t h a t	a r e

departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements

the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
company will continue in business
The directors are responsible for keeping 
proper accounting records that disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Group and 
enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for ensuring 
that the Directors' Report and other 
information included in the Annual Report 
is prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Company Law. They are also 
responsible for ensuring that the Annual 
Report includes information required by 
the AIM Market Rules. 
The maintenance and integrity of the 
Group's web site is the responsibility of 
the Directors; the work carried out by the  18 IDOX plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009

changes that may have occurred to the 
information contained in the accounts

governing the preparation and the 
dissemination of the accounts and other
