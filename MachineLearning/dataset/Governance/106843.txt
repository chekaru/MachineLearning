DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2005
p12-p36  7/20/05  2:10 PM  Page 9 14
To the members of ITIS Holdings plc
We have audited the financial statements of ITIS Holdings plc for the year ended 31 March 2005, which comprise the consolidated profit and loss
account, the balance sheets, the consolidated cash flow statement, the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses and the related notes 1
to 25.  These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the part of
the directors' remuneration report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985.  Our audit work has been
undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors' report and for no other
purpose.  T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As described in the statement of directors' responsibilities, the company's directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in
accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards. They are also responsible for the preparation of the other information
contained in the annual report, including the directors' remuneration report. Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the
directors' remuneration report described as having been audited in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements and
auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the part of the
directors' remuneration report described as having been audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.  We also
report to you if, in our opinion, the directors' report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the company has not kept proper accounting
records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors'
remuneration and transactions with the company and other members of the group is not disclosed.
The directors have also asked us to review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the company's compliance with the nine provisions of
the July 2003 FRC Combined Code specified for our review as if the listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority applied, and we report if it does not.
We are not required to consider whether the board's statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness
of the group's corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the directors' report and the other information contained in the annual report for the above year as described in the contents section, including
the unaudited part of the directors' remuneration report, and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements
or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on
a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the directors' remuneration report described as
having been audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the preparation of the financial
statements and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the circumstances of the company and the group, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the directors' remuneration report described as having been
audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the directors' remuneration report described as having been
audited.
Opinion
In our opinion: 
the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the group as at 31 March 2005 and of the loss of the group
for the year then ended; and
the financial statements and part of the directors' remuneration report described as having been audited have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985.
