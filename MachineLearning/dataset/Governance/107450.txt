Subject to agreement with the Inland Revenue, the Group has United Kingdom tax losses of approximately  6,770k at 
31 December 2006 (2005:  9,709k) available to relieve future trading profits in the United Kingdom.  Additionally, the Group has 
overseas losses of  25,096k at 31 December 2006 (2005:  17,866k) available to relieve future overseas trading profits.
No deferred tax asset is recognised in relation to these losses nor in relation to accelerated capital allowances due to inherent 
uncertainty regarding their recoverability except for losses brought forward in Switzerland, where a deferred tax asset has been 
recognised on the basis of current profits and the probability of future profits in that entity. 
 
A deferred tax asset also arises on share options granted in the year. 
 
A deferred tax liability has been recognised on the fair value gains in the year on cash flow hedges.

    000    000
  Group made of IXDatacentre Frankfurt1  
  & IXDatacentre Zurich1 3,473 3,542
  Units without significant goodwill 53 54

calculations use cash flow projections based on the three year budget ending 31 December 2009 as approved by the Group Board. 
Cash flows beyond this period have been extrapolated with no assumed growth. The discount factor has been determined as 13.6% 
based on the Company's weighted average cost of capital.
The key assumptions used and the approach to determining their value are:
  Assumption How Determined
  Operating margin This is based on detailed plans of IXDatacentre  space available and past experience  
 of management after the period of the official budget. 
  
Management approved budgets are estimated based on past performance and expectations of future developments.
