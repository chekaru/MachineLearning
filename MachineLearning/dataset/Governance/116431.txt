 Compliance
The Board supports the highest standards of corporate
governance and has considered the principles and
provisions of the Combined Code (The Code ) as set
out in the Financial Services Authority's Listing Rules.The
following statement sets out the company's application of
the principles of the Code and the extent of compliance
with the Code's provisions, made in accordance with the
requirements of the Listing Rules.
The Board considers that it has complied with the
provisions set out in the Combined Code during the
period under review with the exception of the matters
set out below.
The group has carried out an assessment of the new
Combined Code and is considering what actions need to
be taken in order to comply to the extent appropriate for
a company of its size.
Non-executive directors
During the year the company has not complied with the
code provision A.3.1. which requires non-executive
directors to comprise not less than one third of the
Board. The Board consisting of seven members, two of
whom are non-executive directors but the Board
considers that the experience and professional expertise
brought by these two directors has been sufficient to
meet the needs of the group.
Code provision B.2.2. states that the Remuneration
Committee should consist of non-executive directors but
as stated in previous years, Mr G T Hogarth, the chief
executive had been invited to serve on the committee
with the two non-executive directors. From 1 January
2004, Mr Hogarth will no longer be a member of the
Remuneration Committee but will be invited from time to
time to act in an advisory role to the non-executive
directors. Mr G T Hogarth's salary continues to be
independently reviewed by the two non-executive
directors.
Code provision D.3.1. states that the Audit Committee
should consist of at least three non-executive directors
but there were only two non-executive directors available
to serve on the committee.
The Board of directors
The Board, two of whom are independent non-executive
directors, exercises full and effective control over the
activities of the group through regular Board meetings.
A total of nine full Board meetings were held during the
year, with additional sub committee meetings to address
specific points. The Board is responsible for the overall
direction of the group and for securing performance from
group assets.
Each director has received written terms of reference in
respect of their responsibilities and written terms of
reference are set out in relation to all Board committees.
Appropriate training is provided to directors both on
appointment and on a continuing development basis.
All directors have direct access to the advice and
services of the company secretary and are able, if
necessary, to seek independent advice on any matter
and an agreed procedure is in place to facilitate this.
Board balance and supply of information
The positions of non-executive chairman and chief
executive are held by separate Board members. The
Board considers that the two non-executive directors
who have served throughout the year are of sufficient
calibre and are independent from management.
The senior independent non-executive director
is Ms K E Swann.
Board members are kept appraised of the actions of the
executive management and are circulated with relevant
papers and proposals prior to Board meetings. Regular
presentations are made to the Board by the heads of the
operating businesses. All directors participate in meetings
and are able to bring their independent judgement to
bear on the decision making process in the areas of
strategy, performance, resources, standards of conduct
and in those matters specifically reserved for the
Board, a schedule of which is available throughout
the organisation.
Appointments to the Board, remuneration and
re-election
The Remuneration Committee, which met formally twice
during the year and again just after the year end to agree
the 2003 bonus payments, is responsible for making
recommendations to the Board on remuneration policy
for all executive directors and senior executives, including
salaries, incentive payments and share options and
continues to appraise remuneration packages
against those of other comparable companies on an
ongoing basis.
Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial period
of up to three years. Nomination for re-election is a
matter for the Board as a whole having regard to the
changing needs of the business.
Directors' remuneration
All Code provisions relating to remuneration of the
directors are dealt with in the Directors' remuneration
report on pages 20 to 23.
Relations with shareholders
The chief executive and finance director normally meet
with substantial institutional investors at least twice a
year and the group encourages attendance and
participation at the Annual General Meeting by
small shareholders.

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee, chaired by the senior independent
non-executive director, makes recommendations to the
Board in respect of the group's financial statements,
internal controls and key accounting policies and
judgements. The committee reviews the findings of the
external auditors and makes recommendations on the
appointment and remuneration of the auditors.The
committee reviews the nature and extent of any
non-audit work undertaken by the external auditors. 
The Audit Committee met three times during the year.
Internal controls
The company has established an ongoing process for
identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks
faced by the company in accordance with the guidance
set out in the Turnbull Report.
The Board is responsible for the group's systems of
internal controls and through the delegated responsibilities
of the Audit Committee has undertaken a review of the
effectiveness of the internal controls for the year, reporting
back to the Board its findings in relation to the main
control mechanisms in place. Whilst the Board are happy
to confirm that the review had not established any
significant weaknesses in internal controls that had
resulted in financial losses, contingencies or uncertainties,
such a system can only provide reasonable and not
absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The group's control environment is the responsibility of
the group's directors and managers at all levels.The
group's organisational structure has clear lines of
responsibility. Operating and financial responsibility for
subsidiary companies is delegated to local boards.The
Board has communicated ethical and operating policies
to all personnel, which are supported by written
procedures and appropriate training. A code of ethics
has been established and published.
The risks facing each of the group's business activities are
kept under regular review and assessment. All subsidiaries
are required to regularly assess key risks and related
control and monitoring procedures. The Board monitors
this process. Local management is responsible for control
procedures in relation to each of the key risks identified
and reporting on the effectiveness of those controls.
Local management reports whether its key controls
have functioned effectively. Standard financial control
procedures operate throughout the group to ensure the
integrity of the group's financial statements.The Board has
established procedures for the authorisation of capital
expenditure including lease commitments.
Corporate Governance procedures were reviewed at
every board meeting throughout the year.
Internal audit
The Board has reviewed the need for an internal audit
function and has concluded that this is not a requirement
at this stage. The Board will continue to review this
decision on an annual basis.
Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries, the directors have a
reasonable expectation that the group and the company
have adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing
the group's financial statements.
Statement of directors' responsibilities
The directors are required by UK company law to
prepare financial statements for each financial year that
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
company and of the group as at the end of the financial
year and of the profit and loss of the group for that year.
The directors confirm that suitable accounting policies
have been used and applied consistently and reasonable
and prudent judgements and estimates have been made
in the preparation of the financial statements for the year
ended 31 December 2003. The directors also confirm
that applicable accounting standards have been followed.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper
accounting records that disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time, the financial position of the
company and the group and to enable them to ensure
that the financial statements comply with the Companies
Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the
assets of the company and of the group and hence for
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Company's report and accounts will be published on
the Company's website and in this regard the directors
accept responsibility for the maintenance and integrity of
the website and any uncertainty arising as a result of the
report and accounts being available via the web in
different legal and accounting jurisdictions.
