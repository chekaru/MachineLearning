incorporate the UK Corporate Governance Code, which sets out the principles of Good Governance, and the Code of Best Practice for listed 
companies. Whilst the Company is not required to comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Company's corporate governance 
procedures take due regard of the principles of Good Governance set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code in relation to the size and the 
stage of development of the Company. 
 
Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors currently comprises two Executive Directors (one of whom is the Chairman), and a Non-Executive Director. The 
Directors are of the opinion that the Board comprises a suitable balance and that the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
have been implemented to an appropriate level.  The Board, through the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer in particular, maintains 
regular contact with its advisers and public relations consultants in order to ensure that the Board develops an understanding of the views of 
major shareholders about the Company.  In 2014, as the company grows, LGO intends to expand the Board to align the Board capability with 
the increased demands of the businesses 
 
Board meetings 
The Board meets regularly throughout the year. For the period ending 31 December 2013, the Board met 8 times in relation to normal 
operational matters. The Board is responsible for formulating, reviewing and approving the Company's strategy, financial activities and 
operating performance.  Day to day management is devolved to the Executive Directors who are charged with consulting the Board on all 
significant financial and operational matters.   
 
All Directors have access to the advice of the Company's solicitors and the Company Secretary ensures necessary information is supplied to the 
Directors on a timely basis to enable them to discharge their duties effectively, and all Directors have access to independent professional 
advice, at the Company's expense, as and when required. 
 
Board committees 
The Board has established the following committees, each which has its own terms of reference:

appropriate accounting policies.  It also monitors internal financial controls as well as overseeing hiring, performance of the external auditors

required to attract an equivalent experienced executive to join the Board from another company.

a committee will however, be kept under regular review by the Board.

controls are designed to safeguard the assets of the Company and to ensure the reliability of financial information for both internal use and 
external publication. Whilst they are aware that no system can provide absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss, in light of 
increased activity and further development of the Company, continuing reviews of internal controls will be undertaken to ensure that they are 
adequate and effective.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (CONTINUED) 
 
General and economic risks 
  Contractions in the world's major economies or increases in the rate of inflation resulting from international conditions; 
  Movements in the equity and share markets in the United Kingdom and throughout the world; 
  Weakness in global equity and share markets in particular, in the United Kingdom, and adverse changes in market sentiment towards 
the resource industry; 
  Currency exchange rate fluctuations and, in particular, the relative prices of US Dollar, Euro, the Trinidadian Dollar and the UK Pound; 
  Exposure to interest rate fluctuations; and 
  Adverse changes in factors affecting the success of exploration and development operations, such as: increases in expenses, changes 
in government policy and further regulation of the industry. 
 
Funding risk 
  The Group or the companies in which it has invested may not be able to raise, either by debt or further equity, sufficient funds to 
enable completion of planned exploration, investment and/or development projects. 
 
Commodity risk 
  Commodities are subject to high levels of volatility in price and demand. The price of commodities depends on a wide range of 
factors, most of which are outside the control of the Company. Exploration, production, processing and transportation costs also 
depend on many factors, including commodity prices, capital and operating costs in relation to any operational site. 
  In particular the Group is subject to the ongoing market movement of the world price of oil and exposed to those risks which that 
entails. 
 
Market risk 
  The ability of the Group (and the companies it invests in) to continue to secure sufficient and profitable sales contracts to support its 
operations is a key business risk 
 
Exploration, development and production risks 
  Oil and gas exploration and development activity is subject to numerous risks, including failure to achieve estimated oil reserves, 
recovery and production rates and capital and operating costs. 
  Success in identifying economically recoverable reserves can never be guaranteed. The Company also cannot guarantee that the 
companies in which it has invested will be able to obtain the necessary permits and approvals required for development of their 
projects. 
  Some of the countries in which the Company operates have native title laws which could affect exploration, development and 
production activities. The companies in which the Company has an interest may be required to undertake clean-up programmes on 
any contamination arising from their operations or operations of previous owners or to participate in site rehabilitation programmes 
which may vary from country to country. The Group's policy is to follow all applicable laws and regulations and the Company is not 
currently aware of any material issues in this regard. 
  Timely approval of production permits and operating plans through the respective regulatory agencies cannot be guaranteed. 
  Availability of skilled workers is an on-going challenge. 
  Unforeseen major failure, breakdowns or repairs required to key items of plant and equipment can result in significant delays, 
notwithstanding regular programmes of repair, maintenance and upkeep. 
 
Business Risk 
The Board regularly evaluates and reviews all business risks when reviewing project timelines. The types of risks reviewed also include: 
  Occupational Health, Safety and Environmental requirements 
  Regulatory and compliance obligations 
  Legal risks relating to contracts, licenses and agreements 
  Insurance risks 
  Political risks deemed where appropriate 
 
Insurance 
The Group maintains insurance in respect of its Directors and Officers against liabilities in relation to the Company. 
 
Treasury policy 
The Group finances its operations through equity and holds its cash as a liquid resource to fund the obligations of the Group. Decisions 
regarding the management of these assets are approved by the Board. 
 
Securities trading 
The Board has adopted a Share Dealing Code that applies to Director, senior management and any employee who is in possession of  inside 
information'.  All such persons are prohibited from trading in the Company's securities if they are in possession of  inside information'.  Subject 
to this condition and trading prohibitions applying to certain periods, trading can occur provided the relevant individual has received the 
appropriate prescribed clearance. 
 
Relations with shareholders 
The Board is committed to providing effective communication with the shareholders of the Company.  Significant developments are 
disseminated through stock exchange announcements and regular updates of the Company website.  The Board views the AGM as a forum for 
communication between the Company and its shareholders and encourages their participation in its agenda.
