35. Principal Accounting Polices
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law 
and 	 accounting 	 st andar ds 	 (Unit ed 	 Kingdom 	 Gener ally 	 Accept ed 	 Accounting 	 Pr actice). 	
The principal accounting polices of the Company are set out below. The policies have 
remained unchanged from the previous year.
Accounting Convention
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
Deferred Taxation
Deferred taxation is recognised on all timing differences where the transactions or event 
that give the Company an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax 
in the future, have occurred by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised 
when it is more likely than not that they will be recoverable. Deferred tax is measured using 
rates of tax that have been enacted or substantively enacted by balance sheet date.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to
write off the cost, less estimated residual value based on prices prevailing at the date
of acquisition, of each asset evenly over its expected useful economic life, as follows:
Short leasehold property Period of the lease
Motor vehicles 25%	per	ann um
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 10-33%	per	ann um
Computers 25-33%	per	ann um
Deferred Consideration
The terms of an acquisition may provide that the value of the purchase consideration, 
which may be payable in cash or shares at a future date, depends on uncertain 
future events such as the future performance of the acquired Company. The amounts 
recognised in the financial statements represent a reasonable estimate at the balance 
sheet date of the amounts expected to be paid and has been classified in the balance 
sheet in accordance with the substance of the transaction. Where the agreement gives 
rise to an obligation that may be settled by the delivery of a variable number of shares to 
meet a defined monetary liability, these amounts are disclosed as debt.
Investments
In the Company's accounts, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less 
provision for any impairment in value.
Lease Commitments
Rental costs under operating leases are charged against profits as incurred.
Profit of Parent Company
As permitted under Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account 
of the Company is not presented as part of these financial statements.
