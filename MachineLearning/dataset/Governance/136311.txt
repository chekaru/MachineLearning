The Board supports the highest standards of corporate
governance and ethical practices within its businesses and notes
both the report of Derek Higgs on the role and effectiveness 
of non executive directors and the accompanying report by 
Sir Robert Smith on audit committee reform. The Company
currently complies with many of the recommendations in these
reports. The Board will be monitoring the outcome of the
consultation process on these reports and resulting amendments
to the Combined Code and will review its corporate governance
practices in accordance with any timescales set down.
Statement of compliance with the Code of Best Practice
The Board has reviewed the Group' s compliance with the Code 
of Best Practice as set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code
annexed to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority
(the Code ). In the opinion of the Directors the Group has
complied with the Code throughout the year.
Application of principles of good governance
The Board of Directors
The Directors believe it is essential for the Group to be led 
and controlled by an effective board. 
The Board presently consists of four Executive and five Non
Executive Directors. The offices of Chairman and Chief Executive
are held separately. Tim Stevenson is the Senior Independent
Director. The Board considers all the Non Executive Directors,
including the Chairman, Michael Davies, to be independent.
Michael Davies has been Chairman since 1992, serving alongside
a number of Chief Executives and Executive Directors during
that time. The Board considers that the Chairman remains
independent of management and free from any business or other
relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise 
of his judgement. All the Non Executive Directors bring strong
independent judgement and considerable knowledge and
experience to Board deliberations. Non Executive Directors do not
participate in any of the Company' s share option or bonus schemes
and their service is non-pensionable. Short biographies of the
Directors are to be found on pages 40 and 41.
All new appointments to the Board are made by the Board 
on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee. On
appointment Directors are offered an appropriate training course
and are thereafter encouraged to keep abreast of matters affecting
their duties as a Director and to attend training courses relevant
to their role. In accordance with the Company's Articles of
Association all Directors submit themselves for election at the
Annual General Meeting following their appointment and
thereafter by rotation at least once every three years.
There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board's
decision including the approval of Group strategy and policies,
major business acquisitions or disposals, major capital projects,
Group budgets and material contracts entered into other than 
in the normal course of business. The Company Secretary is
responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are followed 
and applicable rules and regulations are complied with. There 
is a procedure in place for any Director to take independent
professional advice where considered necessary. For every Board
meeting, reports from the Executive Directors are circulated 
to all Board members, including in-depth financial information.
Senior management give presentations to the Board on
significant matters during the year as appropriate. The Board
meets at least ten times a year and met on 13 occasions during
the period under review.
The Executive Directors are responsible for the day-to-day
management of the Group's businesses, implementation of 
its strategy, policies and budgets and its financial performance.
The Company purchases liability insurance to cover the
Directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Committees of the Board

terms of reference and receives reports of their proceedings.

the Nomination Committee, the Audit Committee and the
Safety Committee.
For the financial period under review the membership 
of these committees comprised the Non Executive Directors:

remuneration of other senior managers, including performance-
related incentive schemes and executive share option schemes.
The committee met four times for the period under review. The
report on Directors' remuneration is set out on pages 46 to 49.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee's responsibilities include reviewing
the Board's structure, size and composition, succession planning

of the role and capabilities required for a particular appointment
proposed by the Nomination Committee.

procedures and safety record and meets quarterly during the year. National Express Group PLC  45
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the half year
and full year results, the Interim Report and the Annual Report
and Accounts. It reviews the accounting policies and procedures
of the Group, its internal control systems and its compliance with
statutory requirements, and considers any matters raised by the
external or internal auditors. The Committee is responsible for
maintaining an appropriate relationship with the external
auditors. The Committee met three times during the period
under review. 
Accountability and audit
The Company has established procedures to ensure that the
Board reviews the effectiveness of the Group's systems of
internal control, including financial, operational, compliance 
and risk management controls as required by the internal
control provisions of the Combined Code. 
The Board has established an ongoing process for identifying,
evaluating and managing significant risks faced by the Group.
This system was in place for the year under review and up to the
date of approval of this Annual Report, and is reviewed regularly
by the Board of Directors. Such a system is designed to manage,
rather than to eliminate, the risks inherent in achieving the
Group's business objectives and can therefore provide only
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss. The procedures in place accord with the
Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code published by
the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. 
The Board maintains full control and direction over appropriate
strategic, financial, organisational and compliance issues and 
has put in place an organisational structure with formally
defined lines of responsibility, delegated authorities and clear
operating processes. 
In particular, there are clear procedures for: 
  financial reporting, within comprehensive financial planning
and accounting frameworks;
  capital investment, with detailed appraisal and authorisation;
and
  health and safety, to review and address issues.
The Board is responsible for, and has reviewed the effectiveness
of, the Group's system of internal control in operation during
the year covered by this report. The systems are designed to
safeguard both shareholders' investments and the assets of 
the Group. This year its review comprised a number of specific
internal control audits of many of the Group's operating
companies by regular reports from the management of risks
applicable to their areas of business. 
In order to assist the Board in this process each division and
business produces an Internal Control Criteria document and
Key Risk Matrix which are cascaded through management levels
and the Audit Committee before being presented to the Board.
This process is reviewed on a six-monthly basis to ensure the
validity and relevance of the key risks reported. The review
covers strategic, financial, compliance and risk management
controls. These procedures are mandated and designed to
manage the risk in order to ensure that the operations achieve
their business objectives.
All subsidiaries are required formally to identify and assess the
key risks they face, reported at half-yearly intervals. Each risk is
assessed based on its likely impact on shareholders' investments
and the Company's assets and its probability of occurrence. The
adequacy of risk mitigation activities is then assessed and rated.
Based on this and the risk analysis performed, local management
provided an overall conclusion on whether appropriate controls
were in place and operating effectively, and confirmed that action
was taken to eliminate any weaknesses identified during the period. 
This process continues to evolve along with the business 
to provide stakeholders with the best assurance that the Group
is aware and managing the key risks highlighted in the six-
monthly reports.
The internal control system is monitored and supported by 
an outsourced internal audit function which reports to
management and the Audit Committee on the Group's financial
and operational controls and reviews the extent to which its
recommendations have been implemented. The Audit Committee,
in addition to its other responsibilities, reviews a summary of the
reports of the internal audit function on the internal controls
systems of the Group. The Audit Committee provides the Board
with an independent assessment of the Group's financial position,
accounting affairs and control systems.
Statements of the respective responsibilities of the Directors 
and Auditors are set out on pages 50 and 51.
Relations with shareholders
The Company maintains a regular dialogue with its institutional
shareholders and fund managers through a variety of meetings 
and presentations throughout the year. During the year, the
Board commissioned an independent review to ascertain the
views of the Company's major investors on its financial
performance and management. The resulting report has been
considered by the Directors and key comments taken on board.
The Annual General Meeting provides an opportunity for all
shareholders to question the Chairman and Directors on a
variety of topics, and information is provided at the Annual
General Meeting on different aspects of the Group's activities.
During the year, written responses are given to correspondence
received from shareholders and all shareholders receive copies 
of the Interim Report and the Annual Report and Accounts.
