Rail 
International growth builds from  
c2c success 
Overview of 2013
2013 saw National Express secure new 
long term contracts in Rail. Building on the 
performance of c2c as the UK's top performing 
franchise, we secured two new contracts 
in Germany to run until 2030. With the c2c 
franchise extended until September 2014, 
our focus is on the significant bid pipeline 
of opportunities in the UK, where we are 
shortlisted for three contracts, and in Germany.
Total revenue in 2013 was  143.0 million (2012: 
 195. 1m), the year-on-year reduction reflecting 
the end of the NXEA franchise during 2012.  
The c2c franchise increased underlying revenue 
by 4%. Normalised operating profit was  9.8 
million (2012:  26.7m) leading to an operating 
margin of 6.9% (2012: 13.7%). The c2c franchise 
was extended by the Department for Transport 
( DfT') in May 2013 and was in 100% profit 
share to the DfT at the end of 2013 (this is  
reset for 2014 until the expiry of the franchise  
in September).
Operational excellence
The Rail division is at the forefront of the Group's 
drive for operational excellence. In December, 
c2c was awarded a 5-star rating by the 
European Foundation for Quality Management, 
the highest level attainable. This is an important 
credential for bidding in rail. c2c's customer 
service is evident - it has been the top rated 
performer of all UK rail franchises throughout 
2012 and 2013, with an annual average 
punctuality of 96.9%. Customer satisfaction 
and National Passenger Survey results are also 
industry leading, with the latter recording a 92% 
score, making c2c the best DfT franchise. 
Our offering to customers continues to expand. 
In August we were selected by the DfT to trial a 
flagship paperless flexible ticketing system using 
smartcards. This follows the addition of 14,000 
extra seats per week in the new May timetable. 
Safety performance also improved with its 
lowest ever rate of employee accidents. 
Cash and returns
Rail offers a capital-light model with lower 
margins but high returns. In 2013 c2c converted 
150% of normalised operating profit into 
operating cash. In the event that National 
Express did not retain the c2c franchise in 
September 2014, the cash outflow associated 
with the franchise handover would be around 
 22 million.
 c2c was awarded a 5-star 
rating by the European 
Foundation for Quality 
Management, the highest  
level attainable. 
Our business model 
How our business works
National Express has a strong operational skills base in Rail, one of the few 
privatised systems in Europe. The Rail industry comprises franchises awarded 
on an exclusive operation basis to private operators. Prices are predominantly 
regulated and costs are substantially fixed around track access, rolling stock and 
franchise payments. Franchisees therefore primarily target passenger volume 
growth, whilst fulfilling their service obligations. 
How we build long term value
c2c is the UK's best performing franchise for both punctuality and passenger 
approval, which is an excellent credential to drive value in the UK and overseas. 
The Group is now starting to exploit its rail expertise in deregulating markets 
outside the UK, particularly in Germany where it has been selected to run its  
first two contracts. National Express is currently bidding for Essex Thameside, 
Crossrail and ScotRail in the UK, and the Berlin S-bahn in Germany.

Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Creating new opportunities
Leveraging our UK rail experience and the 
operational performance credentials of c2c, our 
strategy in Rail is to secure a number of smaller, 
lower risk UK and German rail franchises where 
the franchise risk is acceptable. Other markets 
may liberalise and be attractive in due course 
(for example, Spain). 
In 2013 we won two rail contracts to provide 
services to the Nord Rhine Westphalia regional 
government in Germany. These contracts, 
operating as the  Rhine Munsterland Express', 
will generate  70 million of revenue per year 
and will run for 15 years from December 2015, 
securing our participation in rail until 2030. 
The mobilisation is underway, with the first of 
35 trains procured on behalf of the regional 
authority from Bombardier due to be delivered 
in June 2014. We have also prequalified for the 
Berlin Ringbahn contract, due to be bid later this 
year, and are looking at other suitable contracts 
in Germany, as well as in the neighbouring 
Czech Republic. We are currently working on  
18 opportunities with annual revenue of  1 billion.
In the UK, we have a skilled and experienced 
bid team and have submitted bids to the DfT 
for Essex Thameside, where we are the current 
operator as c2c, and to Transport for London 
for Crossrail. We have also been selected by 
Transport Scotland to bid for the ScotRail 
franchise in April.
c2c has been the top rated performer of all UK rail franchises throughout 2012 and 2013
We were selected by the DfT to pilot a new smartcard 
ticketing system
