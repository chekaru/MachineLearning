Corporate governance
There is commitment to high standards of corporate governance
throughout the group. Following publication of the Higgs Review - 
The Role and Effectiveness of Non-executive Directors and the 
Smith Report - Combined Code Guidance for Audit Committees 
in January 2003, the Financial Reporting Council issued the 
new Combined Code on 23 July 2003, which came into effect 
for reporting years beginning on or after 1 November 2003. The
principles and provisions of the new Code have been considered 
by the board. The board confirms that throughout the year ended 
31 December 2005 the group has complied with the main and
supporting principles as set out in the new Combined Code,
except that non-executives are not appointed for specified periods.
The board is accountable to the company's shareholders for good
governance and the statement set out below describes how the
principles identified in the new Combined Code (appended to the
listing rules) are applied by the group.
Directors
The board consists of a non-executive Chairman, Roger Withers,
two non-executive directors, Raymond Mould (Deputy Chairman) 
and Andrew Parker Bowles, and two executive directors, Mark Elliott
and Ian Renton, of which Mark Elliott is the Chief Executive. Both 
of the non-executive directors are considered by the board to be
independent of management and free of any relationship which could
materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
Biographies of the board members appear on page 25 of this report.
These indicate the high levels and range of business experience
which is essential to manage effectively a business of the size and
complexity of the group. The group continues to experience rapid
growth, and the board is aware of its responsibilities to strengthen 
the board at appropriate times in the group's development.
The board meets at least 12 times each year and has a schedule 
of matters reserved to it for decision. The requirement for board
approval on these matters is communicated widely throughout 
the senior management of the group. This includes matters such 
as material capital commitments, commencing or settling major
litigation, business acquisitions and disposals, and appointments 
to subsidiary company boards.
There is an agreed procedure for directors to take independent
professional advice if necessary and at the company's expense.
This is in addition to the access which every director has to the
company secretary .
The differing roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are 
acknowledged and defined in separate statements approved by 
the board. The key functions of the Chairman are to conduct board
meetings and meetings of shareholders and to ensure that all 
directors are properly briefed in order to take a full and constructive
part in board discussions. The Chief Executive is required to develop 
and lead business strategies and processes to enable the group's
business to meet the requirements of its shareholders.
The senior non-executive director is Raymond Mould and any
concerns relating to the executive management of the company ,
or the performance of the other non-executive directors, can be 
raised with him.
Any director appointed during the year is required, under the provisions
of the company's Articles of Association, to retire and seek election 
by shareholders at the next annual general meeting. The Articles also
require that one third of the directors retire by rotation each year and
seek re-election at the annual general meeting. The directors required
to retire will be those in office longest since their previous re-election
and this will usually mean that each director retires at least every 
three years, although there is no absolute requirement to this effect.
In order to comply with the new Combined Code, but avoid the
expense of amending the company's Articles to deal with this single
point, the board has resolved that each director will retire at least
every three years, even if this is not strictly required by application 
of the provisions of the Articles.
Full details of directors' remuneration and a statement of the company's
remuneration policy is set out in the Remuneration report appearing
on pages 31 to 33. The members of the Remuneration Committee 
and the principal terms of reference of the Committee appear on
page 31. Executive directors abstain from any discussion or voting 
at full board meetings on Remuneration Committee recommendations,
where the recommendations have a direct bearing on their own
remuneration package. The details of each executive director's
individual package are fixed by the Committee in line with the 
policy adopted by the full board.
Nomination Committee
The members of the Nomination Committee are H R Mould
(Chairman) who was appointed on 1 November 2005, R D Withers 
and A H Parker Bowles. M J Barnes served as Chairman of the
nomination committee until his resignation on 31 October 2005.
The Committee meets as required, but not less than once a year.
Its responsibilities include reviewing the board structure, size 
and composition, nominating candidates to the board to fill board
vacancies when they arise, and recommending directors 
who are retiring by rotation to be put forward for re-election.
The Committee also ensures that all board appointees undergo
training as appropriate. 30 Arena Leisure Plc Annual Report 2005

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is scheduled to meet at least three times a year. It is comprised of R D Withers (Chairman), A H Parker Bowles 
and H R Mould from 1 November 2005. M J Barnes served as a member of the Audit Committee until his resignation on 31 October 2005.
Meetings are attended by senior representatives of the group's external auditors and appropriate members of senior management.
Amongst other matters, the Committee considers the company's annual and interim financial statements and any issues raised by the 
auditors in relation to the financial statements, financial systems and internal control within the group.

Communication
The company places a great deal of importance on communication with
its shareholders. The full report and accounts are sent to all shareholders
and to other parties on request who have an interest in the group's
performance. Shareholders also have direct access to the company ,
and the company responds to numerous letters and enquiries from
shareholders on a wide range of issues. There is regular dialogue with
individual institutional shareholders, and all shareholders have the
opportunity to put forward questions at the company's annual general
meeting. The board makes a presentation at the meeting to highlight
the key business developments during the financial year.
Audit and internal control
The respective responsibilities of the directors and the auditors in
connection with the accounts are explained on page 28 within the
Director's report and page 61 in the report of the independent
auditors and the directors' statement on going concerns appears 
in the Director's report.
The directors are responsible for the company's system of internal
control which is designed to provide reasonable but not absolute
assurance against material misstatement or loss. The key procedures
that the directors have established to provide effective internal
financial controls are as follows:
Financial reporting: a detailed formal budgeting process for all group
businesses culminates in an annual group budget which is approved
by the board. Results for the company and for its main constituent
businesses are reported monthly against the budget to the board.
Financial and accounting principles: comprehensive financial 
and accounting controls are required by the board for effective
financial control.
Capital investment: the company has clearly defined guidelines 
for capital expenditure. These include annual budgets, detailed
appraisal and review procedures, levels of authority and due 
diligence requirements where businesses are being acquired.
The board confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying,
evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the group,
which complies with the guidance  Internal Control: Guidance for
directors on the combined code'. This has been in place throughout
the current period and up to the date of approval of the financial
statements. The process is regularly reviewed by the board.
Following publication of guidance for directors on internal control
(The Turnbull Guidance), the board confirms its commitment to the
management of risk within the organisation. Information provided by
the group's risk committee, internal management reporting, external
auditors and industry sources provides the basis on which the board
carries out its review; to identify , evaluate and manage any risk deemed
significant to the achievement of the company's strategic objectives.
The group does not have an internal audit function. Following the
necessary evaluation the board has concluded that due to the 
modest size of the group, a formal internal function is not required.
Limited internal audit work is however carried out by the group
finance department.
During the period under review , the group has operated a risk review
committee chaired by A H Parker Bowles. The committee is appointed
from members of the board (including M J Elliott (from 1 October 2005)
and R I Renton) and senior management. Its role is to identify , evaluate
and report formally to the board on significant risk issues.
The Audit Committee will keep the scope and cost effectiveness 
of both internal controls and the external audit under review . The
independence and objectivity of the external auditors is also considered
on a regular basis, with particular regard to the level of non-audit fees.
The split between audit and non-audit fees for the year under review
appears on page 43. The non-audit fees were paid in respect of tax
advice and compliance work, due diligence reports and other advice
and are considered by the Audit Committee not to affect independence
or objectivity .
Two of the directors of the group are on the board of the group's 
joint venture, At The Races. At least one of the group's directors will
attend all significant meetings of the joint venture, where they will use
their influence to ensure that the highest standards of internal control
are maintained.
The listing rules - the model code
