Risk management report
The Group's business, financial condition, results and future operations 
could be materially adversely affected by a number of factors.
General exploration risk
A gas discovery, Johnson, has been announced in the adjacent acreage to 
the east of licence PL001 on a structure that extends into the licence area, 
but drilling on the licence will be required to confirm the presence of gas on 
the Company's acreage. In the same acreage a successful nine well appraisal 
drilling campaign on the Sea Lion discovery was completed by the end of 
2011 and led the operator to conclude that the field is commercial and will 
be developed. The last two appraisal wells made further discoveries of oil 
and gas in the Casper and South Casper prospects and a wet gas discovery 
in the Beverley prospect. Whilst these results are encouraging with respect 
to the oil and gas potential of the area, no commercial volumes of oil or gas 
have yet been discovered in the licence area. There is no certainty that such 
discoveries will ever be made. 
Mitigation: An independent Competent Persons Report has been 
completed to risk the prospects using industry standard methods.
Commercial risk
Even if the Group recovers quantities of oil or gas, there is a risk the Group 
will not achieve a commercial return. Historically, oil prices have fluctuated 
significantly and are affected by numerous factors over which the Group has 
no control.
Mitigation: As production is a number of years away current price volatility 
is not expected to have a significant impact on the eventual outcome.
Future funding requirements
The Group will need to raise additional funding to undertake drilling and 
there is no certainty that this will be possible.
Mitigation: Regular discussions are held with current and prospective 
investors.
Environmental factors and insurance risk
Although the Group intends to be in compliance with all applicable 
environmental laws and regulations, and to insure its operations are in 
accordance with industry practice, there are certain risks inherent to its 
activities that could subject the Group to extensive liability. Insurance cover 
will not be available for every risk faced by the Group.
Mitigation: The Group applies industry best practice standards.
Title and payment obligations
The licence will be subject to applications for renewal and any renewal is 
usually at the discretion of the relevant government authority.
Mitigation: Regular discussions are held with Falkland Islands 
Government officials.
Political risk
The Argentine Government has not relinquished its claims to sovereignty 
over the Falkland Islands and the surrounding maritime areas. 
Mitigation: The UK Government has stated that it has no doubt about its 
sovereignty and remains fully committed to the offshore prospecting policy 
pursued by the Falkland Islands Government.
 
Retention of business relationships
It is likely that the Group will rely significantly on strategic relationships 
with other entities in the oil and gas industry such as service providers. The 
loss of these services could have an adverse effect on the business, financial 
position and results of operations of the Group.
Mitigation: The Group establishes good working relationships and 
oversight arrangements with its operating partners. Argos r esources Ltd Annual Report & Accounts 2011
