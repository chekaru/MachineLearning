Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Corporate governance statement
As an AIM company, Argos Resources Ltd is not required to 
comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code. Although the 
Company does not comply with the Code, the board has sought 
to comply with a number of the provisions of the Code in so far 
as it considers them to be appropriate to a company of this size 
and nature.
An outline of how it does this is as follows:
The board
The Argos Resources Ltd board is currently comprised of three 
executive and three non-executive directors. It is therefore 
compliant with the Code's recommendation for smaller 
companies that at least two of the board members are 
independent non-executive directors.
Whilst the non-executive directors are shareholders in the 
Company and hold options to acquire shares in the Company, 
this is not considered a significant threat to their independence. 
One of the non-executive directors, James Ragg, became a senior 
employee of Argos Georgia Limited, a substantial shareholder in 
the Company, with effect from 1 January 2013. The board has 
considered, in conjunction with its advisors, whether this has 
any impact on Mr Ragg's independence and has concluded that it 
does not. Apart from these matters and their directors' fees the 
non-executive directors have no other financial interests in the 
Company or business relationships that would interfere with 
their independent judgement.
Dennis Carlton is the senior non-executive director. Should 
shareholders have concerns which have not been adequately 
addressed by the chairman or managing director, he can be 
contacted by sending an email to info@argosresources.com. The 
same address can also be used to contact James Ragg, chairman 
of the audit committee.
The board has agreed to meet four times per year or more 
frequently if it needs to do so. There is a schedule of matters 
reserved for board approval and this ensures that the board 
exercises control over all key areas.
The board's executive chairman, Ian Thomson, is not considered 
independent as he holds a substantial number of the Company's 
shares and he has been on the board for more than 10 years. The 
Company considers, however, that the benefit of his experience 
and long involvement with business in the Falkland Islands more 
than outweighs the benefits of an independent chairman. He 
meets with the non-executive directors, without the other 
executive directors present, at least once per year.
The Company complies with Rule 21 of the AIM Rules for 
Companies regarding dealings in the Company's shares and has 
adopted a code on dealing in securities to ensure compliance by 
directors.
Audit committee
The audit committee comprises James Ragg (committee 
chairman), Dennis Carlton and Chris Fleming. The board 
considers all three members of the committee to be independent 
and is satisfied that at least one, James Ragg, has recent and 
relevant financial experience.
The committee invites the remainder of the board and the 
external auditor to attend its meetings as observers. It meets the 
external auditor, in the absence of the remainder of the board, at 
least once per year.
The role and responsibilities of the audit committee have been set 
out in written terms of reference which include:
Z Z risk assessment, particularly, but not exclusively, in respect of 
financial reporting risks;
Z Z assessment of processes relating to the Company's control 
environment;
Z Z oversight of financial reporting;
Z Z evaluation of internal and external audit processes; and
Z Z development and implementation of policy on the provision of 
non-audit services by the external auditor.
The full terms of reference for the audit committee are available 
on the Company's website.
The audit committee has established procedures by which 
concerns regarding accounting or audit matters may be brought 
to the committee chairman's attention and the chairman can be 
contacted by sending an email to info@argosresources.com.
The audit committee has considered the need for an internal 
audit function and regards this as unnecessary given the 
Company's current size and lack of complexity.
The audit committee makes recommendations to the board 
regarding the appointment, reappointment and removal of 
external auditors. At the Annual General Meeting the 
shareholders are requested to authorise the audit committee to 
fix the remuneration of the external auditors.
The audit committee recognises that, for smaller companies, it is 
cost-effective to procure certain non-audit services from the 
external auditor but there is a need to ensure that provision of 
such services does not impair, or appear to impair, the auditor's 
independence or objectivity. The committee has therefore put in 
place a written policy on the use of external auditors which 
includes clear limits on the level of non-audit work beyond which 
the chairman of the audit committee must be consulted before 
the assignment can be awarded to the external auditor.
The audit committee was satisfied throughout the year that the 
external auditor's objectivity and independence were in no way 
impaired by the nature of the non-audit work undertaken or any 
other factors including the level of non-audit fees charged.
The audit committee held two meetings during the year. During 
the period since the year end one further meeting has been held.
The chairman of the audit committee reports to the board on the 
committee's discussions and minutes of the committee's 
meetings are circulated to all directors.
Nominations committee
The board considers that, at its current stage of development, the 
Company does not require a separate nominations committee. 
The functions of that committee, namely consideration of any 
new appointments of directors to the board, are therefore carried 
out by the board as a whole.
No appointments to the board were made in the year under 
review. 14

Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee comprises Dennis Carlton (committee chairman), Chris Fleming and James Ragg. The board considers 
that all members of the remuneration committee are independent.
The committee's role is to establish the Company's policy for the remuneration of the executive directors in order to ensure that all 
members of the executive management of the Company are provided with appropriate incentives to encourage enhanced performance.
The committee met formally once during the year under review and held a number of informal discussions. No recommendations for 
increases in remuneration have been made.
Directors' remuneration for the year is as set out below:

*  In 2012 J Hogan relinquished the right to any future pension entitlement, which was accruing at a rate of 5% of salary. The total amount of $32K, which had accrued, was 
transferred to a newly set up scholarship fund and amounts will continue to accrue to the scholarship fund at the same rate.
Internal controls and risk management
The board of directors is responsible for implementing and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group's system of internal control.
The system of internal control is designed to mitigate rather than eliminate risk and therefore provides reasonable rather than total 
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
As noted above, the board does not consider it necessary, at the Company's current stage of development, to implement an internal 
audit capability.
Shareholder relationships
During the year the executive directors held a number of meetings with shareholders and potential shareholders. These meetings 
included formal roadshows and presentations, analyst briefings and media interviews. All directors are kept informed regarding these 
meetings.
Going concern
As at the date of approval of the financial statements the board is of the opinion that the Group and Company have adequate resources 
to continue in existence for at least 12 months from that date. The board has therefore continued to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparation of the financial statements.
Capital
Capital is managed to ensure that the Group is able to continue as a going concern and consists of cash and equity. The Group is not 
subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
