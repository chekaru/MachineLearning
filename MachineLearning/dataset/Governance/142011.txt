The Group is making taxable profits in The Netherlands where it pays two taxes: Corporate Income Tax (CIT ) at 25.5% and State Profit Share 
(SPS ) at 24.5% on oil and gas activities. The Group has made taxable losses in its other countries of operation, but has not recognised deferred 
tax credits for these losses as they are not expected to be used in 2011 - for analysis of the tax charge by country of operation please see note 2, 
Segmental Information .
Netherlands
The Dutch Regulation for Depreciation At Will 2001 (DAW ) was updated in early 2009 to be applicable for both Dutch CIT and for SPS on 
expenditure on business assets committed to in 2009 and 2010. Under the changes, E&P companies are able, for tax purposes, to depreciate in 
full the carrying value of qualifying investments over two years, 2009 and 2010, at up to 50% in each year, rather than on a unit of production basis. 
Investment in new fixed assets qualifies if the investment was made in 2009 or 2010 and as long as the assets subject to a DAW claim are in use 
before 1 January 2012. 
In the 2009 Annual Report, the Group noted the updates to DAW, but at that time had not yet decided to take advantage of the rule changes. The 
Group now has elected to utilise DAW for capital expenditure by its Dutch subsidiary, Northern Petroleum Nederland B.V . (NPN ), in both 2009 and 
2010. Use of DAW has resulted in tax losses for those years, which are available to be carried back in respect of prior years' profits.
The 2010 tax charge relates to deferred tax liabilities arising on timing differences between NPN's accounting and fiscal balance sheets, (which 
include additional allowances taken under DAW); unutilised tax losses; and a current tax adjustment in respect of prior years. By taking carry back 
of 2009 and 2010 tax losses into account, NPN has recognised a tax receivable of  2,540,000 for overpaid CIT and SPS in earlier years. 
NPN had a routine tax audit in 2010. The tax positions for 2005 to 2008 have been agreed with the tax authorities and a deferred tax adjustment is 
recognised in respect of prior year timing differences of  1,727,000.
In 2010 the prior year losses capitalised as a deferred tax asset ( 4,076,000) were fully utilised. The tax loss for the fiscal year 2010 has been offset 
against the remaining prior year profits. At year end 2010 the Group has capitalised the remaining tax loss not yet utilised amounting to  1,483,000.
b) Factors affecting tax expense / (credit)
The tax expense for the year is higher than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 28% (2009: 28%). The difference is explained below:
