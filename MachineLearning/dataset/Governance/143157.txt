Corporate governance statement
The Board is committed to achieving high standards of corporate governance, integrity and business ethics for all of the activities 
of the Group. Under the rules of AIM, the Group is not required to comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2010 ( the Code'). 
Nevertheless, the Board has taken steps to comply with the Code insofar as it can be applied practically and appropriately, given 
the size of the Group and the nature of its operations. The main ways in which it does this are described below. 
Board composition and operation
The Board currently comprises two Executive and three Non-Executive Directors. The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are 
separated and clearly understood. The Chairman is responsible for the Board. The Chief Executive is responsible for the operating 
performance of the Group. A formal schedule of matters requiring Group Board approval is maintained, covering such areas as 
Group strategy, approval of budgets, financial results, Board appointments and dividend policy. The Board normally meets once 
a month and additional meetings are called when required. Comprehensive briefing papers are sent to all Directors prior to each 
scheduled Board meeting. Directors are able, if necessary, to take independent professional advice in the furtherance of their 
duties at the Company's expense. 
Due to the infrequency of senior appointments, the Board does not maintain a standing Nomination Committee but will form one 
as appropriate if required. The current Chief Executive's and Group Finance Director's appointments were approved by the Board, 
after receiving a recommendation from a committee of the Board consisting of the Non-Executive Directors that was formed 
specifically for that purpose. The committee undertook a comprehensive recruitment process and was assisted by independent 
external recruitment consultants.
The Board regularly conducts an appraisal of its own performance and that of each Director consisting of individual assessments 
using prescribed questionnaires that are completed by all Directors. The results are reviewed and individual feedback given, by the 
Senior Non-Executive Director in respect of assessments of the Chairman and by the Chairman in respect of assessments of each 
of the other Directors and of the Board as a whole. 
All Directors are subject to retirement by rotation in accordance with the Articles of Association.
The service contracts of Executive Directors require one year's notice or less.
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee consists of all three Non-Executive Directors. The Audit Committee met on two occasions during the year 
and all members attended.
The Audit Committee has terms of reference in place which have been formally approved by the Board and are made available 
at the AGM and on the Company's website. Its primary responsibilities include reviewing the effectiveness of the Group's internal 
control systems and monitoring the integrity of the Group's financial statements and external announcements of the Group's results.
The Audit Committee also approves the appointment and remuneration of the Group's external auditors and satisfies itself that they 
maintain their independence regardless of any non-audit work performed by them.
The respective responsibilities of the Directors and external auditors in connection with the financial statements are explained in 
the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities on page 25 and the auditors' reports on pages 26 and 59. Details of services provided 
by and fees payable to the auditors are shown in note 5 of the Group financial statements.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have been the Company's external auditors for many years. The Audit Committee considers that 
the relationship with the auditors is working well and remains satisfied with their effectiveness. Accordingly, it has not considered 
it necessary to date to require the firm to re-tender for the audit work. The auditors are required to rotate the audit partner 
responsible for the Group and subsidiary audits every five years. The current audit partner was first appointed in respect 
of the financial year ended 31 May 2010. There are no contractual obligations restricting the Company's choice of auditors. 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of all three Non-Executive Directors. The Remuneration Committee met on a number 
of occasions during the year and all members attended. Its remit is to determine, on behalf of the Board, appropriate short and 
long-term total reward packages for the Executive Directors of the Group and its subsidiaries. The Remuneration Committee 
will also satisfy itself that good practices apply to all Group employees through the relevant management structures. Its terms 
of reference will be made available at the AGM and on the Company's website.
Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors have received appointment letters setting out their terms of appointment. All Non-Executive Directors are 
appointed for one year with renewal for further one year terms if performance is satisfactory. The Chairman and the Senior Non-Executive 
Director have served for more than ten years on the Board, which does not comply with the Code's definition of independence. However, 
the Board considers that the Chairman's experience is invaluable to the Group. The Senior Non-Executive Director has announced his 
intention to step down following the AGM. The Board considers that the other Non-Executive Director meets the independence tests. 
The appointment of new Non-Executive Directors to the Board is considered by the whole Board. 24

Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group maintains a system of internal control, to provide it with reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial information that is used within the business and for publication and the safeguarding 
of assets. There are inherent limitations in any system of internal control and accordingly even the most effective system can 
provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. Some examples of internal controls 
operated by the Group are given below and elsewhere in this statement.
The Group's organisational structure has clear lines of responsibility. Operating and financial responsibility for subsidiary companies 
is delegated to operational management. 
There is a comprehensive budgeting and financial reporting system which, as a matter of routine, compares actual results to the 
budgets approved by the Group Board. Management accounts are prepared for each subsidiary company and for the Group on 
a monthly basis. Significant variances from budget are thoroughly investigated. In addition, updated profitability forecasts are 
prepared to reflect actual performance and revised outlook as the year progresses.
Cash flow forecasts are prepared regularly, to ensure that the Group has adequate funds for the foreseeable future.
Investment policy, acquisition proposals and major capital expenditure projects are authorised and monitored by the Group Board.
The Group's risk management programme, which assesses key risks and the required internal controls that are delegated to Directors 
and managers at all levels in the Group, is reviewed regularly in order to ensure that it continues to meet the Board's requirements.
Shareholders
The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors will always make themselves available to meet with shareholders. Each AGM 
is a particular opportunity for this. Normal relationships with shareholders are maintained by the Executive Directors who brief 
the Board on shareholder issues and who relate the views of the Group's advisers to the Board.
Share capital structures
Details of the Company's share capital can be found in the  Takeover Directive requirements' section of the Directors' Report 
and in note 22 of the Group financial statements.
Going concern basis
The Group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, 
are set out in the Business and Financial Review. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing 
facilities are also described in the Business and Financial Review. In addition, note 20 of the Group financial statements includes: 
the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of financial 
instruments and hedging activities; and its exposure to price, interest rate, credit and liquidity risk.
The Group has an agreement with The Royal Bank of Scotland Group for senior credit facilities totalling  55.0 million, details 
of which can be found in note 19 of the Group financial statements.
Accordingly, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing 
the annual financial statements.
