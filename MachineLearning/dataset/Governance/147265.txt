Directors' Report  
 
 
14 
 
Principal Activity 
 
The principal activities of the Group are the exploration for gold and copper resources in Papua New 
Guinea (PNG). The Group's strategy is to explore for and, where the Directors believe that it is 
commercially feasible, develop deposits of gold and/or copper within the territory of PNG. 
 
Thirteen Exploration Licences have so far been granted by the Minister for Mining in PNG.  Twelve 
of the licences are located in the central part of New Britain Island and the thirteenth is in the East 
Sepik region of the mainland. Two further licences in New Britain are under application. 
 
Financial overview 
 
The loss for the year is in line with the Directors' expectations. With significant funding being raised in 
February 2013, and further funds of $4.2m ( 2.5m) raised subsequent to the year end (see note 22), the 
Directors are satisfied that the Group has sufficient working capital to complete the planned exploration 
programmes. 
 
A detailed review of the Group's business, including its targets and strategies is given in the Chairman's 
Statement and the Review of Operations.  
 
Results and Dividends 
 
The results for the year are in line with Directors' expectations.  The Directors do not recommend a 
dividend. 
 
Going Concern   
 
It is the prime responsibility of the Board to ensure the Group remains a going concern.  The Group 
raised funds of $3.9m through a private equity placing in February 2013.  At 31 December 2013 the 
Group had cash of $3,626,880 (2012: $6,996,182) and no borrowings.  The Group has raised further 
funds of $4.2m ( 2.5m) through a share placing in June 2014.  The Board considers it has sufficient 
cash to maintain the Group as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of 
signing the annual report and accounts. Although Papua Mining was successful in raising finance in 
June 2014, there is no assurance that it will be able to obtain adequate finance in the future. However 
the Directors have a reasonable expectation that they will secure additional funding when required. For 
this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements.

Substantial Shareholdings 
 
As at 11 June 2014, being the latest practical date prior to publication of this document, the Company 
was aware of the following holdings of 3% or more of the issued share capital of the Company: 
 
 
Directors' remuneration 
 
The remuneration of the Directors during the year was made on the recommendation of the 
Remuneration Committee, taking into consideration remuneration packages of directors in comparable 
businesses and in order to retain high quality executives within a competitive market place. 
 
Salaries and fees were paid to the Directors for the year ended 31 December 2013.  In addition, certain 
directors also received benefits in kind, principally private medical insurance, and fees were paid to 
businesses with which some of the Directors are associated. 
 
The Group made payments into the private pension schemes of two of the Directors. 
 
No share options were granted to the Directors during the year. 
 
Full details of Directors' emoluments are set out in note 19 of the financial statements. 
 
Environmental Policy 
 
The Group's projects are subject to the relevant PNG laws and regulations relating to environmental 
matters.  
 
The Group's strategy is to explore for and, where the Directors believe that it is commercially feasible, 
develop deposits of gold and/or copper within the territory of PNG. It is the Group's intention to conduct 
its activities in a professional and responsible manner, for the benefit of the Company's shareholders, its 
employees and the national and local communities within which it operates. 
 
The Group aims to, at all times, conduct its operations in an environmentally responsible manner and in 
accordance with relevant legislation. The Group aims to adopt Best Practice policies as recommended 
by the World Bank, the International Council on Mining & Metals (ICMM ) and others where the Group 
deems local legislation to be inadequate in terms of environmental protection. The Group has in place a 
detailed Field Operations Guidelines Manual which covers in considerable detail the measures to be 
taken by field personnel to minimize any negative environmental impact of current exploration activities 
on the environment. 
 
The Group also recognises the enormous potential of its activities for positive impact on the 
communities in which it operates and strives to optimise these positive impacts as far as is possible. 
 
The Papua Mining plc (PM plc ) Executive Directors have extensive experience and expertise in 
environmental aspects of mineral exploration and mining.  The Group Country Manager, Chris Muller, 
who, in addition to his significant geological qualifications and experience, is a renowned lepidopterist 
who has participated in many important environmental studies in PNG and who is credited with the 
discovery of a significant number of new butterfly species.  All Group personnel are encouraged to take 
an active interest in environmental matters. 
 
Directors' Indemnities 
 
The Group has purchased insurance to cover its Directors and officers against the costs of defending 
themselves in legal proceedings taken against them in that capacity and in respect of any damages 
resulting from those proceedings. The insurance does not provide cover where the Director has acted 
fraudulently or dishonestly.
