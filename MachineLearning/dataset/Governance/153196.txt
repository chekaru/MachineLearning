Corporate governance statement
.................................................................................................................................................................
There is commitment to high standards of corporate governance throughout the Group.
Although compliance with the Combined Code is not required for AIM companies, the
Board confirms that since admission to AIM the Company has complied with all of the
principal provisions set out in Section 1 of the 2003 FRC Combined Code, except as
noted below.
The Board is accountable to the Company's shareholders for good governance and the
statement set out below describes how the principles identified in the Combined Code
are applied.
Board composition The Board consists of a non-executive chairman, Albert Fischer, three other non-executive
directors and three executive directors. John Brady is the Chief Executive Officer. The
Board considers all of the non-executive directors to be independent as none hold a
material interest in the shares of the Company. While serving as non-executive directors of
Plant Health Care, Inc. Albert Fischer, Robert Chanson and Thomas Isler were issued with
options for their services to that company. At the flotation these options were exchanged
for options in Plant Health Care plc. The Company will not make any further award of
options to non-executive directors.
Biographies of the Board members appear on pages 9 to 11 of this report. These indicate
the high levels and range of business experience which is essential to manage effectively a
business of the size, complexity and geographical spread of the Group. Concerns relating
to the executive management of the Company or the performance of the non-executive
directors can be raised in confidence by contacting the independent directors through the
Company Secretary.
Workings of the Board The Board meets at least eight times each year and more frequently where business needs
require. The Board has a schedule of matters reserved to it for decision and the requirement
for Board approval on these matters is communicated widely throughout the senior
management of the Group. This includes matters such as approval of the Group's strategic
plan; extension of the Group's activities into new business or geographic areas; any
decision to cease to operate all or any material part of the Group's business; changes
relating to the Group's capital structure; major (over $1 million) bids by PHC Reclamation;
contracts that are material strategically or by reason of size; investments including the
acquisition or disposal of interests in the voting shares of any company or the making of
any takeover offer; and the prosecution, defence, or settlement of litigation material
to the Group.
There is an agreed procedure for directors to take independent professional advice if
necessary and at the Company's expense. This is in addition to the access which every
director has to the Company Secretary who is also charged by the Board with ensuring
that Board procedures are followed.
The differing roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are acknowledged and defined in
separate statements approved by the Board. The key functions of the Chairman are to
conduct Board meetings and meetings of shareholders and to ensure that all directors are
properly briefed in order to take a full and constructive part in Board discussions. The Chief
Executive is required to develop and lead business strategies and processes to enable the
Group's business to meet the requirements of its shareholders. Job: 13336D-- Date: 10-05-05 Area: A1 Operator: DD Typesetter ID: DESIGN: ID Number: 0951 TCP No. 7 Time: 09:37 Rev: 0 Gal: 0013

To enable the Board to function effectively and allow directors to discharge their
responsibilities, full and timely access is given to all relevant information. In the case of
Board meetings, this consists of a comprehensive set of papers, including regular business
progress reports and discussion documents regarding specific matters.
Re-election of directors Any director appointed during the year is required, by statute and under the provisions of
the Company's articles of association, to retire and seek election by shareholders at the
next annual general meeting. The articles also require that one third of the directors retire by
rotation each year and seek re-election at the annual general meeting. The directors
required to retire will be those in office longest since their previous re-election and this will
usually mean that each director retires at least every three years, although there is no
absolute requirement to this effect. In order to comply with the Combined Code, but avoid
the expense of amending the Company's articles to deal with this single point, the Board
has resolved that each director will retire at least every three years, even if this is not strictly
required by application of the provisions of the articles.
Remuneration of
directors
A statement of the Company's remuneration policy and full details of directors'
remuneration are set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 15 to 18. The Chairman is a
member of the Remuneration Committee and attends meetings of the Committee to discuss
the performance of the executive directors and make proposals as necessary. Executive
directors abstain from any discussion or voting at full Board meetings on Remuneration
Committee recommendations where the recommendations have a direct bearing on their
own remuneration package. The details of each executive director's package are fixed by
the Committee in line with the policy adopted by the full Board.
Communication The Company places a great deal of importance on communication with its shareholders.
The Company publishes an interim statement as well as its full report and accounts. Both
are mailed to all shareholders and upon request to other parties who have an interest in the
Group's performance. Regular communication with shareholders also takes place via the
Company website www.planthealthcare.com.
There is regular dialogue with major shareholders as well as general presentations after
the interim and preliminary results. All shareholders have the opportunity to put questions at
the Company's annual general meeting and the Board makes a presentation at the
meeting to highlight the key business developments during the financial year.
Internal controls and risk
management
The directors are responsible for the Group's system of internal control and for reviewing its
effectiveness. However, such a system can only provide reasonable, but not absolute,
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The directors believe that the Group has internal control systems in place appropriate to its
size and nature. However they also recognise that the Group is ambitious and seeking
significant growth. There is an on-going process in place to review the control systems
across the Group to ensure that they develop in anticipation of this growth.
The Board is also developing a formal ongoing process for identifying, evaluating
and managing the significant risks faced by the Group, which complies with the
guidance provided by the document: Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the
Combined Code. Job: 13336D-- Date: 10-05-05 Area: A1 Operator: PH Typesetter ID: DESIGN: ID Number: 0952 TCP No. 7 Time: 09:37 Rev: 0 Gal: 0014

Compliance with the
Combined Code
The Board has reviewed the Combined Code and is satisfied that it adheres to its main and
supporting principles. The relevant provisions in the Combined Code with which the
Company did not comply during the year ended 31 December 2004 are as follows:
A.2.2 - As explained above, the Chairman, Albert Fischer, owns share options arising
from share option plans in existence before admission to AIM. However the Board
considers that he is able to exercise independent judgement and that the benefits he brings
to the Company far outweigh any potential threats to the Company that may arise from his
appearing not to be independent.
B.2.2 - The Remuneration Committee has established the compensation structure for the
Executive Board members, as required by the Combined Code. However, it has not
extended its definition of Senior Management  to include the first layer of management
below the Board level. The Board has, however, reviewed and approved a summary of
compensation arrangements for the direct reports of Executive Board members.
C.3.5 - Because of the limited size and scope of its operations, the Company does not
maintain an internal audit function.
External audit matters Independence
The Audit Committee has sole responsibility for assessing the independence of the external
auditors, BDO Stoy Hayward LLP. The Committee has had due regard to the document
published in May 2003 by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales
Reviewing Auditor Independence: Guidance for Audit Committees. Each year the
Committee undertakes to:
  Seek reassurance that the external auditors and their staff have no family, financial,
employment, investment or business relationship with the Company. To this end the
Committee requires the external auditor and their associates to confirm this in
writing, and detail the procedures which the auditor has carried out in order to make
this confirmation.
  Check that all partners engaged in the audit process are rotated at least every
5 years.
  Assess the likely impact on the auditors' independence and objectivity before
awarding them any contract for additional services. It is Company policy to require
Audit Committee approval for all non-audit services provided by the independent
auditors.
  Having as a standing agenda item auditor independence issues at each Audit
Committee meeting.
Other matters
There has been no material variation in services provided by the external auditor after
the year-end.
