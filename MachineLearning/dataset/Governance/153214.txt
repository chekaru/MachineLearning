Corporate governance statement
.................................................................................................................................................................
In July 2003, the Financial Reporting Council published the Principles of Good
Governance and the Code of Best Practice (the Combined Code ).
Since admission to AIM, Plant Health Care plc has taken note of the Combined
Code and has applied its principles of corporate governance commensurate with the
Company's size, notwithstanding that the rules of the London Stock Exchange do
not require companies that have securities traded on AIM to formally comply with the
Combined Code.
The Board is accountable to the Company's shareholders for good governance and the
statement set out below describes how the principles identified in the Combined Code
are applied.
Board composition The Board comprises a non-executive chairman, three executive directors and three other
non-executive directors.
The Board considers all of the non-executives to be independent in judgment and
character, while acknowledging the following departures from the Combined Code's
anticipated criteria for independence:
(i) While serving as non-executive directors of Plant Health Care, Inc., Albert Fischer,
Robert Chanson and Thomas Isler were granted options for their services to that
company. At flotation, these options were exchanged for options in Plant Health
Care plc. The Company will not make any further awards of options to
non-executive directors.
(ii) Robert Chanson was first appointed to the Board of the Group in 1995. He has
therefore now served as a director of the Group for over the recommended
maximum of nine years.
Biographies of the Board members appear on pages 9 and 10. These indicate the high
levels and range of business experience which is essential to oversee effectively a business
of the size, complexity and geographical spread of the Group. Concerns relating to the
executive management of the Company or the performance of the non-executive directors
can be raised in confidence by contacting the independent directors through the
Company Secretary.
Board committees The Board has established audit and remuneration committees, as described on
page 11. No separate nominations committee has been established; the full Board
acts as such a committee when changes to the Board of directors are proposed.
Workings of the Board The Board meets on a pre-scheduled basis eight times each year and more frequently
when business needs require. The Board has a schedule of matters reserved to it for
decision and the requirement for Board approval on these matters is communicated widely
throughout the senior management of the Group. The schedule includes matters such as:
approval of the Group's strategic plan; extension of the Group's activities into new
business or geographic areas; any decision to cease to operate all or any material part of
the Group's business; changes relating to the Group's capital structure; major (over
$1 million) bids by PHC Reclamation; contracts that are material strategically or by reason
of size; investments including the acquisition or disposal of interests in the voting shares of
any company or the making of any takeover offer; and the prosecution, defence, or
settlement of litigation material to the Group. Job: 14386A-- Planthealth Date: 23-04-07 Area: A1 Operator: KW Typesetter ID: DESIGN: ID Number: 3614 TCP No. 7 Time: 18:03 Rev: 1 Gal: 0013

There is an agreed procedure for directors to take independent professional advice if
necessary at the Company's expense. This is in addition to the access which every director
has to the Company Secretary. The Secretary is charged by the Board with ensuring that
Board procedures are followed.
The differing roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are acknowledged and defined in
separate statements approved by the Board. The key functions of the Chairman are to
conduct Board meetings and meetings of shareholders and to ensure that all directors are
properly briefed in order to take a full and constructive part in Board discussions. The Chief
Executive is required to develop and execute business strategies and processes to enable
the Group's business to meet the requirements of its shareholders.
To enable the Board to function effectively and allow directors to discharge their
responsibilities, full and timely access is given to all relevant information. In the case of
Board meetings, this consists of a comprehensive set of papers, including regular business
progress reports and discussion documents regarding specific matters.
The Board conducted an internal Board Performance Evaluation during the year in line
with the requirements of the Combined Code. The Board intends to implement certain of
the recommendations which arose from this review.
Re-election of directors Any director appointed during the year is required under the provisions of the Company's
articles of association to retire and seek election by shareholders at the next annual general
meeting. The articles also require that one-third of the directors retire by rotation each year
and seek re-election at the annual general meeting. The directors required to retire will be
those in office longest since their previous re-election.
Remuneration of
directors
A statement of the Company's remuneration policy and full details of directors'
remuneration are set out in the Remuneration Committee report on pages 15 to 19.
Executive directors abstain from any discussion or voting at full Board meetings on
Remuneration Committee recommendations where the recommendations have a direct
bearing on their own remuneration package.
Communication The Company places a great deal of importance on communication with its shareholders.
The Company publishes an interim statement as well as its full year report and accounts.
Both are mailed to all shareholders and upon request to other parties who have an interest
in the Group's performance. Regular communication with shareholders also takes place
via the Company website www.planthealthcare.com.
There is regular dialogue with major shareholders as well as general presentations after
the interim and preliminary results. From time to time, these meetings involve the
non-executive chairman or other non-executive directors. All shareholders have the
opportunity to put questions at the Company's annual general meeting and the Chief
Executive Officer makes a presentation at the meeting to highlight the key business
developments during the financial year.
Internal controls and risk
management
The directors are responsible for the Group's system of internal control and for reviewing its
effectiveness. However, such a system can provide only reasonable, but not absolute,
assurance against material misstatement or loss. Job: 14386A-- Planthealth Date: 23-04-07 Area: A1 Operator: KW Typesetter ID: DESIGN: ID Number: 3615 TCP No. 7 Time: 18:03 Rev: 1 Gal: 0014

The directors recognise that the Group is ambitious and seeking significant growth. There
is an on-going process in place to review regularly the control systems across the Group to
ensure that they develop in anticipation of this growth. Twice a year, prior to the
announcement of the Group's interim and preliminary financial results, the Finance
Director presents to the Board for discussion and approval a summary of the key internal
controls in place during the prior period and proposals for enhancements to these controls
in the forthcoming period. Based on this process, the directors believe that the Group has
internal control systems in place appropriate to its size and nature.
The Board also has in place a formal ongoing process for identifying, evaluating
and managing the significant risks faced by the Group, which complies with the
guidance provided by the document: Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the
Combined Code.
The Company does not maintain an internal audit function. The directors do not believe
such a function is justified in terms of the scale of the Group or the costs involved.
Auditor independence The Audit Committee has sole responsibility for assessing the independence of the external
auditors, BDO Stoy Hayward LLP. The Committee has had due regard to the document
published in May 2003 by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales: Reviewing Auditor Independence: Guidance for Audit Committees. Each year
the Committee:
  Seeks reassurance that the external auditors and their staff have no family, financial,
employment, investment or business relationship with the Company. To this end, the
Committee requires the external auditors and their associates to confirm this in
writing, and detail the procedures which the auditors have carried out in order to
make this confirmation.
  Checks that all partners engaged in the audit process are rotated at least every
five years.
  Assesses the likely impact on the auditors' independence and objectivity before
awarding them any contract for additional services. It is Company policy
to require Audit Committee approval for all non-audit services provided by the
independent auditors.
  Has as a standing agenda item at each Audit Committee meeting the consideration
of auditor independence.
