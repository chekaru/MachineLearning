 Directors' Remuneration Report
ASHTEAD GROUP PLC   .37.
Except where otherwise stated above, the Retirement Benefits Plan provides:
  in the event of death, between leaving service and retirement while retaining membership of the Plan, a spouse's pension equal to
50% of the member's deferred pension calculated at the date of death plus a return of his contributions;
  in the event of death in retirement, a spouse's pension equal to 50% of the member's pension at the date of death;
  an option to retire at any time after age 50 with the Company's consent.  Early retirement benefits are reduced by an amount 
agreed between the Actuary and the Trustees as reflecting the cost to the Plan of the early retirement;
  pension increases in line with the increase in retail price inflation up to a limit of currently 5% a year (although the Government is 
currently proposing that this limited inflation proofing be reduced); and
  transfer values do not include discretionary benefits.
Mr Dressel is a member of the US defined contribution plan to which the Group contributed  3,511 in the year ( 2,024 in 2002).

Investment Incentive Plan
This long-term incentive plan provides for executive directors, who so elect, to invest all or a portion of their annual cash bonuses in
shares of the Company and, thus, become eligible for matching awards in the form of shares which only vest subject to demanding
performance conditions.  The maximum number of shares which may vest under issued matching awards (being, other than in
relation to the first investment, three times the number of investment shares purchased by the director) is shown below:
Awarded on
At 30 April 2002 29 July 2002 At 30 April 2003
George Burnett 1,422,006 - 1,422,006
Ian Robson 474,107 176,469 650,576
Bruce Dressel 650,878 - 650,878
The matching awards are made in respect of investment shares acquired by the director with all or part of their bonus for the
previous financial year.  The matching awards only vest, in whole or part, based on the annual growth in the Company's earnings per
share in the three year period following the award over that of the year ended 30 April immediately prior to the date of the award and
on the Company's Total Shareholder Return (TSR ) performance relative to a comparator group over the three year period from 8
October 2001 (when the Company's share price at close was 72p) to 8 October 2004 for the awards held on 30 April 2002 and over
the three year period from 29 July 2002 to 28 July 2005 for the award granted in 2002/3.  The comparator group comprises all of the
FTSE 250 mid-cap stocks other than investment trusts
The above performance conditions have been chosen because they are felt most closely to align the interests of senior management
with the interests of shareholders, by rewarding management for achieving superior relative total shareholder return performance
compared with the FTSE 250 as a whole, excluding investment trusts.  The FTSE 250 is considered to be the Stock Exchange index
most appropriate to the size and scale of the Company's operations. Directors' Remuneration Report
Annual Report & Accounts 2003
Vesting of the matching awards is based on the following required performance grid:
Vesting operates on a scaled basis for performance between the target levels shown in the grid above.  Performance is measured at
the end of the three year performance period when the awards either vest in full or part or lapse completely.  For performance
measurement purposes earnings per share is based on the profit before exceptional items measured under consistently applied
accounting policies.
In connection with the operation of the Plan, the Company established an Employee Share Ownership Trust which:
(a) on 21 and 22 January 2002, purchased 2,722,575 shares at an average cost of 57p per share, being the number of shares 
potentially equal, at the maximum performance level, to the matching awards granted.  Ownership of these shares was 
conditionally transferred to each director on 15 April 2002 subject to forfeiture to the extent that the required performance 
conditions are not attained.   175,541 of these shares subsequently reverted to the Trust when a director left the Company and his
matching awards were thus forfeited; and
(b) the 175,541 shares referred to at (a) plus 42 shares remaining in the Trust from the original purchase and a further 886 shares 
bought by the Trust on 12 August 2002 at a price of 48p per share were conditionally transferred to Mr Robson on 24 September 
2002 in satisfaction of the matching award of 176,469 shares made to him.  This award is also subject to forfeiture to the extent 
that the required performance conditions are not attained.
The executive directors have also waived their entitlement to any dividend on the shares conditionally transferred to them until the
conclusion of the relevant performance period.
The Company charges against profit each year an amount equal to one-third of the expected cost of the proportion of the matching
award expected to vest at the end of the three year performance period.

The above discretionary options are exercisable subject to the following performance criteria: 
(i) As was usual at that time, options granted in 1992, 1994 and 1995 were not subject to any performance criteria;
(ii) In line with recommendations extant at the time from Institutional shareholder representative bodies, options granted in 1997, 
1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 were conditional on the Group achieving real growth in earnings per share of 2% per annum over any 
continuous three year period during the option period;
(iii) Options granted in 2002 and subsequently now require real growth in earnings per share of 3% per annum over any continuous 
three year period before they become exercisable.
The Remuneration Committee consider that the current performance hurdle is appropriately challenging while still providing
employees with a realistic opportunity to earn shares in the Company through their own efforts.
It is the Company's practice to normally award share options in blocks taking into account the results of the Group and/or the
operating division in the financial year ending on the 30 April immediately before the date of grant and individual performance and
contribution in determining the amount of individual awards.
On 30 August 2002, George Burnett exercised options over 521,362 ordinary shares in the Company, which had been granted to him
on 16 September 1992 at an exercise price of 14.87p per share.  On the date of exercise, the closing market value of the Company's
share was 36.25p.  Mr Burnett elected to retain the shares issued to him on the exercise of these options.  The market price of the
Company's shares at the end of the financial year was 7.75p and the highest and lowest share prices during the financial year were
54.50p and 2.50p respectively.
Mr Dressel held an award over 250,000 units under the Company's Cash Incentive Scheme, which was granted on 22 February 2000
at a price of 102p per unit until 22 February 2003 when they lapsed due to the performance criteria not being satisfied.  Mr Dhaiwal
also holds 50,000 units under the Cash Incentive Scheme which were granted to him on 22 February 2000 when he was not a
director.  This award is subject to the same performance conditions as apply to the Company's unapproved share option scheme
and is exercisable in the period from 22 February 2003 to 21 February 2010.  If the performance criteria are satisfied at any point
during that period and the options exercised, the difference between the mid market price of Ashtead Group shares on that day and
the grant price multiplied by the number of units held will be paid to Mr Dhaiwal by way of a cash award.
