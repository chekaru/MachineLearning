Corporate governance
Corporate governance
As an AIM listed company, Renew is not required to follow the provisions of the Combined Code, as set out in the Financial Services 
Authority's Listing Rules. The Directors, however recognise the importance of, and accordingly support, the principles of good corporate 
governance as contained within the Combined Code. The Directors normally seek to follow the Code to the extent considered relevant for 
an AIM listed company but are unable to achieve compliance with the Code in a number of areas this year, primarily because of the 
lack of independent Non-executive Directors. These matters are explained in further detail in the sections below.
The Board of Directors
The Board currently comprises the Chief Executive Officer, the Non-executive Chairman, one Executive Director and one independent 
Non-executive Director. Brief biographies of the Directors are given on pages 36 and 37.
As the Company has only had one independent Non-executive Director within the meaning of the Code during the year, it has not been 
compliant with the requirement of the Code that more than half of the Board should be comprised of independent Non-executive Directors. 
The composition of the Board is reviewed regularly. Appropriate training, briefings and induction are available to all Directors on appointment 
and subsequently as necessary, taking into account existing qualifications and experience. New Directors are subject to election by 
shareholders at the first AGM after their appointment. 
The Board met formally ten times in the year with all Directors in attendance, plus Committee meetings dealing with the daily business of the 
Company being held as necessary. The Board receives written and oral reports from the Executive Directors ensuring matters are considered 
fully and enabling Directors to discharge their duties properly. There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board's decision 
ensuring the maintenance of control over strategic, financial and operational matters. 
In addition, procedures are in place for the Directors to seek independent professional advice, if necessary, at the Company's expense.
Board Committees
R Harrison's previous role as an Executive Director prevents him from being considered as independent under the Combined Code 2003. 
Nevertheless, the Board operates with a number of Board Committees. J Bishop, the sole independent Non-executive Director, acts as 
Chairman of the Audit Committee and R Harrison acts as Chairman of both the Remuneration and Nominations Committees. 
The Board delegates clearly defined powers to its Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees. Each of the Board's Committees has 
carefully drafted terms of reference. 
The Remuneration Committee, which comprises R Harrison and J Bishop, determines and agrees with the Board the framework and policy 
of executive remuneration packages, including bonuses, incentive payments, share options or awards and pension arrangements. Further 
information concerning the Remuneration Committee is set out in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 38 to 40. 
The Nominations Committee, which comprises the entire Board, monitors the composition of the Board and recommends the appointment of 
new Directors. The Nominations Committee, with all Directors present, has held two meetings during the year to discuss nomination matters.
The Nominations Committee terms of reference include:
(a) to review the structure, size and composition of the Board;
(b) to consider succession planning for Directors and senior executives;
(c) to identify and nominate, for approval by the Board, suitable candidates to fill Board vacancies; and
(d)  to make recommendations to the Board on the contents of letters of appointment, Directors' duties, re-appointment or re-election of 
Directors upon conclusion of a specified term or retirement by rotation.
The Audit Committee has held three meetings to consider Audit Committee business. The Audit Committee consists of J Bishop and 
R Harrison. The Executive Directors are invited to attend Audit Committee meetings but at least two meetings are held each year with the 
external Auditors at which the Executive Directors are not present. The Audit Committee considers the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk 
management and control systems of the Group, and reports the results to the Board. It reviews the scope and results of the external audit, its 
cost effectiveness and the objectivity of the Auditors. The Audit Committee monitors the non-audit work performed by the Auditors to help 
ensure that the independence of the Auditors is maintained. The Audit Committee also reviews the interim statement, the preliminary 
announcement and accounting policies. 
The Board forms a General Purposes Committee from time to time as it deems necessary. This Committee is constituted by the two Executive 
Directors and considers individual business matters which have been specifically delegated to it by the Board.

Internal controls
Throughout the financial year ended 30 September 2010 and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts, the Group has 
fully complied with the relevant provisions of the Code and the T urnbull guidance. The Directors acknowledge that they have overall responsibility 
for the Group's system of internal control and for reviewing and monitoring its effectiveness. The system of internal control is designed to 
manage and mitigate, rather than eliminate, the risks to which the Group is exposed and therefore provides a reasonable, but not 
absolute, assurance against a company failing to meet its business objectives or against material misstatement or loss. Consequently, the 
Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing significant risks faced by the Group and that it is 
regularly reviewed by the Board. 
The Group operates a risk management process, which is embedded in normal management and governance processes. There is a system 
of self-examination of risk areas and controls by subsidiaries and departments within the Group. Where significant risks are identified, the 
probability of those risks occurring, their potential impact and the plans for managing and mitigating each of those risks is reported. The 
Group operates a series of controls which include the annual strategic planning and budgeting process, short-term cash monitoring achieved 
by means of weekly forecasts which are compared against budget and previous forecasts, clearly defined capital investment guidelines and 
levels of authority and a clear organisational structure within which individuals' responsibilities are identified and monitored. These results and 
processes are monitored, updated, reviewed and considered by the Board. The Group has established a series of minimum standards in a 
number of financial and operational areas with which each business within the Group must comply. Group management monitors and reviews 
compliance with these requirements on a periodic basis. Due to the size and nature of the Group, the Board does not consider that a separate 
internal audit function is necessary. For the last four years and including 2010, the Group has carried out a programme of internal audit 
conducted by the Group Commercial Director and by members of the various subsidiaries' finance teams. This system of peer review 
promotes best practice as well as ensuring that Group minimum requirements as to procedures and internal controls are being complied with. 
The reports from these internal audits are made available both to the Board and to the external Auditors.
Going concern
The Directors have reviewed the budgets and forecasts prepared by the Group and its trading subsidiaries and consider that at the time of approving 
the financial statements, there is a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Directors' remuneration
The Company's policy on the remuneration of Executive Directors, and information relating to the Directors' remuneration and their interests 
in share options, is included in the Directors' Remuneration Report.
Directors' and officers' indemnity
The Articles of Association provide that each Director or other officer or Auditor of the Company shall be indemnified by the Company against 
losses, costs and expenses he may sustain or incur in connection with the performance of his duties of office, to the fullest extent permitted by law.
Shareholder relationships
Members of the Board have dialogue with individual shareholders during the year. In addition to the Annual and Interim Report and Accounts, 
the Chairman addresses shareholders at the AGM and invites questions to any members of the Board. 
The AGM is normally attended by all Directors and provides an opportunity for communication with those shareholders attending. Notice of 
the AGM is given to shareholders at least 21 days in advance and separate resolutions are proposed on each substantially separate issue. 
Where resolutions at the AGM are dealt with by show of hands, the results of proxy votes for and against are still announced. 
Financial and other information about the Group is available on the Company's website: www.renewholdings.com, from which shareholders 
can also access their shareholding details via a link to the website of Capita Registrars plc.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM will be held on 26 January 2011, the Notice for which is set out on page 83. The Notice contains special business relating to the 
renewal of the Board's power to allot equity shares. Brief details of the purpose and effect of the proposed resolutions are set out in the 
Notice of AGM and the notes thereto on page 84. 
Shareholders should complete the proxy form accompanying this document in accordance with the notes contained in the Notice of AGM.

The Board approved the Corporate Governance Report on 23 November 2010.
