The Board
The Company supports the concept of an effective board leading and controlling the Group. The Board is responsible
for approving Group policy and strategy and the Directors are free to seek any further information they consider
necessary. All Directors have access to independent professional advice at the Group's expense. 
The Board has a written statement of its responsibilities and there are written terms of reference for the Nomination,
Remuneration and Audit committees. The Chairman and Non-Executive Director, whose time commitment to the
Company are commensurate with their remuneration, hold other positions as set out in the biographies below.
The Board meets regularly on dates agreed each year for the calendar year ahead. This is typically seven times per year
although additional meetings are called as and when deemed necessary.
The Board consists of a non-executive Chairman, one other non-executive Director, a Chief Executive and a Finance
Director/Company Secretary. This provides a broad background of experience and a balance whereby the Board's
decision making cannot be dominated by an individual. The Chairman of the Board is Richard Clothier and the Group's
