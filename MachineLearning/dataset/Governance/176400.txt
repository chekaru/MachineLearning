Corporate Governance Report
This Corporate Governance Report describes the manner in which 
the Company has applied the Principles of Good Governance set out 
in Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance and
whether or not it has complied with the Code provisions. In July 2003,
the Financial Reporting Council (FRC ) issued the Combined Code 
on Corporate Governance  (the FRC Code ), in response to the Higgs
Review on Non-executive Directors and the Smith Review on Audit
Committees. The FRC Code was then revised in 2006.
Statement of Compliance with the Combined Code
The Company has been in compliance with the provisions set out in
Section 1 of the FRC Code throughout the year.
Application of the Principles of the FRC Code
The Principles of Good Corporate Governance are detailed in the 
FRC Code under four areas. These have each been reviewed by the
Directors and commented upon below:
a) Directors
The Board is structured under a non-executive Chairman, and includes
three executive Directors, and two other non-executive independent
Directors, who were selected for appointment because of their wide
industrial and commercial experience. In addition, there is a Group
Executive Committee, chaired by the Group Chief Executive, which is
comprised of the executive Directors and other key executives within
the Group. Brief details of the Board are included on page 4.
The Directors consider that there is in place an effective Board which
leads and controls the Group, with clear divisions of responsibility
between running the Board and running the Group's businesses. 
The Board is responsible for the strategic decisions regarding the
Group, including the setting of commercial strategy and approval of
Group budgets and financial statements. It also approves significant
financial and contractual commitments made by the Group. The Board's
Terms of Reference more fully describe the responsibilities of the
Board, and may be found on the Company's website.
The Board delegates certain of its responsibilities to the Audit,
Remuneration, Nominations, and Health, Safety & Environment (HSE )
Committees. The Group Chief Executive, together with the Group
Executive Committee, is responsible for the implementation of the
decisions made by the Board, and for the day-to-day conduct of 
the Group's operations. 
The Board meets formally on a regular basis (nine times in 2007); 
and in addition there were three meetings of the Audit Committee 
in 2007, together with three meetings of the Remuneration Committee, 
four meetings of the Nominations Committee and four meetings of 
the HSE Committee. There was full attendance at every Board meeting
and Committee of the Board during the year. Other Committees are
appointed by the Board to deal with treasury matters and specific
issues such as acquisitions and disposals. The minutes arising from 
the Committee Meetings are available to the Board.
Procedures are in place to ensure that the Directors are properly
briefed so that the decisions taken by the Board are based on 
the fullest available information. At every Board Meeting there are
reviews of operational, financial and administrative matters. Health,
safety & environmental performance is reviewed by the Board on 
a regular, and at least quarterly, basis; while social and ethical issues,
agreement of budgets and levels of insurance cover are reviewed
whenever appropriate.
There is a procedure by which all Directors can obtain independent
professional advice at the Company's expense in furtherance of their
duties, if required.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee leads the process for Board appointments,
and supervises management development and succession plans. It also
makes recommendations to the Board on all new Board appointments.
The Committee, which consists entirely of non-executive Directors, 
was chaired by J R Kerr-Muir until his retirement from the Board 
on 1 May 2007, and subsequently by M Clark, and its composition 
is shown on page 4. Its Terms of Reference may be found on the
Company's website.
The appointment of new non-executive Directors to the Board is controlled
by the Committee, assisted by appropriate external recruitment
consultants. In conjunction with the external consultant, consideration is
given to the role and the capabilities required for a particular appointment.
Based on agreed criteria, the consultant then produces a shortlist of
candidates. The Committee members interview these candidates, then
present their recommendation to the Board. Consideration is also given
to the number of other posts held by the candidates, and their ability 
to devote sufficient time to discharge their duty as a non-executive
Director. J R Kerr-Muir retired from the Board on 1 May 2007. M Clark
was appointed non-executive Chairman and I F R Much was appointed
the Senior Independent Director, upon J R Kerr-Muir's retirement. 
D G Best was also appointed a non-executive Director on 1 May 2007.
During the year, the Board undertook a formal review to evaluate its own
performance, and that of its Committees and individual Directors; this
process involved the completion and review of performance assessment
questionnaires, and appraisal interviews. The results of the evaluation
process are used to improve Board performance and to determine the
training needs of the Directors. D G Best and I F R Much, in consultation
with the executive Directors, undertook an evaluation of the Chairman's
performance, and concluded that M Clark provided effective leadership
of the Board. Based on the results of the performance evaluation
process, the Chairman considers that each member of the Board, 
the Board collectively, and its Committees, continue to contribute
effectively to the running of the Company.
In accordance with the Company's Articles, Directors submit themselves
for re-election at the Annual General Meeting following their
appointment and thereafter at intervals of no more than three years.
b) Directors' Remuneration
The Remuneration Report on pages 24 to 29 describes how the Board
has applied itself to remuneration matters.
c) Accountability and Audit
The Audit Committee Report on pages 22 and 23 describes the role
and activities of the Audit Committee and its relationship with the
internal and external auditors. 
The Company has a Whistle Blowing policy that is communicated
throughout the Group. This policy provides employees with the opportunity
to report unethical or illegal corporate conduct. I F R Much is the
Company's Senior Independent Director. His position provides
shareholders with an alternative channel of communication if they have
a concern that the Chairman, Group Chief Executive or Group Finance
Director has failed to resolve, or for which such contact is inappropriate. 
d) Relations with Shareholders
The Company maintains regular contact with its institutional shareholders.
Twice a year, the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director
undertake a series of meetings with the Company's major shareholders,
following the announcement of the full year and interim results, 
to discuss both strategic objectives and the detailed performance 
of the business. During 2007, the Company's non-executive Chairman,
also attended the full year and interim results announcements to shareholders and analysts, in March and August respectively. No other
non-executive Director formally met with shareholders during the year.
The Senior Independent Director is available to attend shareholder meetings,
if this is requested by shareholders, so providing an alternative channel
of communication between the Company and its shareholders. The
Company's largest shareholders were invited to meet D G Best
following his appointment as a non-executive Director on 1 May 2007.
The Company makes constructive use of the Annual General Meeting
to communicate with private investors. A presentation of the Company's
performance is given at the AGM, and a copy of the presentation, along
with other investor relations material, is available on the Company's website.
All resolutions at the 2007 AGM were passed unanimously on a show
of hands. Details of the proxy voting received by the Company for the
AGM 2007 are set out in the table below.
