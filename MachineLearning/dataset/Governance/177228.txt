 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
Corporate governance
The Company is committed to the principles of corporate governance, and although not required to do so by the AIM Rules, the
directors have decided to provide corporate governance disclosures comparable with those required of a listed company.
There is commitment to high standards of corporate governance throughout the Group. The Board confirms that for the year
ended 31 December 2010 the Group has complied with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the FRC 2008 Combined Code,
with the exception of the matters referred to below:
  Provision A.3.3 of the Combined Code states that the Board should appoint one of the independent non-executive
directors to be the senior independent director. Under the Code, the Chairman is not considered independent. The
Chairman of the company has been appointed to this role as he is considered to be the most appropriately experienced
director to undertake this role; however the Board accepts that this is not in compliance with provision A.3.3. The
position will be reviewed from time to time and where contact through normal channels does not satisfy investors'
concerns, then alternative contact via the non-executive directors will be arranged as appropriate.
  Provision A.6.1 requires a statement to be made of the Board's formal and rigorous annual evaluation of its own
performance and that of its committees and individual directors. No such formal review of Board performance takes
place, as the Board considers an informal rolling programme of review to be more appropriate given the Group's
current scale.
The Company complies with the Combined Code so far as it is practicable and appropriate for a public company of its size. The
Company also follows the recommendations on corporate governance of the Quoted Companies Alliance (QCA).
The Board is aware of the new UK Corporate Governance code which will replace the existing Code for financial years
beginning on or after 29 June 2010 and is considering the implications for the Group.
The Board is accountable to the Company's shareholders for good governance and the statement set out below describes how
the principles identified in the Combined Code have been applied.
Directors
At 31 December 2010, the Board comprised a Chairman, two executive Directors, namely the Chief Executive, and the Finance
Director, and two independent non-executive Directors, all of whom bring a wide range of skills and experience to the Board.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separated and clearly defined. The Chairman is primarily responsible for the
working of the Board and the Chief Executive for the running of the business and implementation of Board strategy and policy.
The Chief Executive is assisted in managing the business on a day-to-day basis by an executive management Board whose span of
control covers the outsourcing and hosting and the scheduling businesses; it meets at least monthly and comprises of the global
operations director, global sales director and finance director. Notwithstanding the requirements of the Code, each of the
non-executive directors is considered by the Board to be independent despite their interests in the share capital detailed on
page 10 because they are considered to be independent from management and free from any relationship which could materially
interfere with the exercise of their judgement.
12 The non-executive directors make a significant contribution to the functioning of the Board, thereby helping to ensure that no
one individual or group dominates the Board's decision-making process. In particular the non-executive directors constructively
challenge and help develop proposals on strategy.
The Board met on 6 scheduled occasions during 2010. The Board's focus is on strategy formulation, policy and control. A
corporate governance framework has been adopted by the Board, which identifies its roles and responsibilities and how these
are discharged.
Biographies of the Board members appear on page 9 of this report.
There were 6 Board meetings in 2010. The attendance of directors is set out below:
L N Bury 6
M Duffin 6
H Fitzwilliam-Lay 6
R Burger 6
S A Gillings 6
One of the responsibilities of the Chairman is to ensure that Board members receive sufficient and timely information regarding
corporate and business issues to enable them to discharge their duties. The adequacy of this information is periodically reviewed.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and the Board has established a procedure
whereby Directors, wishing to do so in the furtherance of their duties, may take independent professional advice at the expense
of ServicePower.
The Company Secretary is also charged with ensuring that any new Board members are equipped to fulfil their duties and
responsibilities. The induction and personal development of both executive and non-executive Directors is subject to ongoing
review to ensure ServicePower operates in accordance with the provisions of the Combined Code.
Non-executive Directors are appointed for a three year term after which their appointment may be extended upon mutual
agreement. It is envisaged that the maximum term for a non-executive Director under this regime is unlikely to exceed nine
years. However, as noted on page 10, L N Bury has served for greater than nine years and therefore offers himself for annual re-
election. In accordance with the Company's Articles of Association, one-third of the Board are required to retire by rotation
each year, or if their number is not three or an integral multiple of three, the number nearest to but not exceeding one-third,
shall retire from office. However, over a three year period all Directors must have retired from the Board and faced re-election.
Additionally, each director must retire at the third annual general meeting following his appointment or reappointment in a
general meeting.
The senior independent non-executive director is L N Bury, and concerns relating to the executive management of the Company
or the performance of the other non-executive directors can be raised with him. Whilst no formal review of performance takes
place, if a member of the Board was not performing, and as the Board compromises five members it would be immediately
apparent, then remedial action would be the responsibility of Mr Bury in his capacity as Chairman.
13 Committees of the Board
The Board maintains three standing committees; all of which operate within written terms of reference. They are the Audit
Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Nominations Committee. Their minutes are circulated for review and
consideration by the full complement of Directors, supplemented by oral reports from the committee chairman, or other
members. The Nominations Committee meets on an ad hoc basis as required to make recommendations in relation to all new
appointments to the Board. The Audit Committee met on 16 March 2010 and was attended by H Fitzwilliam-Lay, L N Bury and
R Burger; M Duffin and S A Gillings attended by invitation.
The members of the committees are as follows:
Audit Committee H Fitzwilliam-Lay (Chairman of the Audit Committee), L N Bury, R Burger
Remuneration Committee L N Bury (Chairman of the Remuneration Committee), H Fitzwilliam-Lay, R Burger
Nominations Committee R Burger (Chairman of the Nominations Committee), L N Bury, H Fitzwilliam-Lay
The reports of the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee follow on pages 16 to 22.
Internal control
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the system of internal control covering all controls including financial,
operational and compliance controls and risk management and for reviewing its effectiveness throughout ServicePower. Such a
control system can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss, and is designed not
to eliminate risk, but to enable ServicePower to achieve its corporate objectives within a managed risk profile. The Board is
responsible for determining strategies and policies for risk and control, whilst management is responsible for designing, operating
and monitoring risk management and control processes to implement Board policies effectively.
The Board confirms that an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing ServicePower's significant risks has
operated throughout the year and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts. This process has been subject
to regular annual review by the Board and accords with Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code 
contained in the Combined Code. During the year, steps have been taken to embed internal control and risk management
further into the operations of the business and to deal with areas of improvement which come to the Board's and management's
attention. The key elements of the process are as follows:
- Strategic risks are considered by both the Board and the Executive Committees in the context of an agreed strategic
framework, which is revised during the year through one or more meetings devoted specifically to the long term
strategic direction of ServicePower. Annually, ServicePower produces a three year plan to reflect and respond to the
strategic challenges facing ServicePower, which is approved by the Board. Detailed financial and operating plans are
developed for the year ahead and monthly reports are provided to the Board covering actual performance against plan,
analysis of significant variances and scrutiny of key performance indicators.
- The Executive Committee manages the business on a day to day basis and the Divisional Directors are responsible for
embedding risk management and control in accordance with the corporate governance framework.
The Board undertakes a formal annual assessment of the overall risk management in order to form a view on the effectiveness of
the system of internal controls. The Board has concluded that the size of the company and the volume of transactions currently
does not warrant an Internal Audit department. This is subject to annual review.
14 There has been no change in ServicePower's internal control over financial reporting during the 2010 fiscal year that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Relations with shareholders
ServicePower values its dialogue with both institutional and private investors. Effective two-way communication with fund
managers, institutional investors and analysts is actively pursued and this encompasses issues such as performance, policy and
strategy. During 2010 ServicePower Directors held meetings with 6 institutional investors whose combined shareholding
represented over 46 per cent. of the total issued ordinary share capital of the Company.
All investors are encouraged to participate in the Annual General Meeting at which the Chairman presents a review of the results
and comments on current business activity. The Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination Committees will be
available at the Annual General Meeting to answer any shareholder questions.
The Notice of the Annual General Meeting is circulated more than 20 working days before the Meeting and ServicePower will
continue its practice of proposing only unbundled individual resolutions.
