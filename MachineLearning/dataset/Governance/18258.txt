Corporate social responsibility
The Group is aware that its activities 
can have an impact on a wide range 
of stakeholders including employees, 
neighbouring communities and local 
and national governmental agencies 
and departments. The Group strategy 
focuses on the integration of its policies 
to maximise opportunities for its people 
and the communities within which we 
operate, whilst minimising the impact 
of its activities on the environment, 
neighbours and other interested parties. 
Environment
The Group is conscious that its activities 
c o u l d	h a v e	a	s i g n i fi c a n t	im p a c t	o n	t h e	
environment. The Group considers the 
potential environmental impact of its 
operations at every stage of a mine's life 
cycle from the initial planning phase 
t o	fi n a l	r e s t o r at i o n .	P r o m o t in g	e x c e l l e n c e	
in environmental standards is a primary 
objective of the business and these issues 
are key to the strategic development 
of each site.
During the planning phase of each 
potential project, a full environmental 
assessment is carried out which is 
included within a formal planning 
application as the Environmental 
Statement. The potential impact on 
the environment at each stage of the 
development and operation of a site 
is considered and reported by senior mine 
management which engages specialist 
external consultants as required. 
The Group implements many initiatives 
to improve the local environment and 
environmental legacy issues. At the former 
Grievehill site in Ayrshire, the Group employs 
rangers to assist in supporting suitable 
nesting areas for birds of prey, including 
the rare hen harrier. This enabled hen 
h ar r i e r	c h i c k s	t o	fl e d g e	du r in g	t h e	y e ar .	
At Grievehill, the Group improved the 
condition of 150 hectares of degraded 
bog through a re  wetting programme.
At Muir Dean in Fife, the Group is 
implementing a scheme to resolve what 
is considered to be the worst coal mine 
legacy pollution of a water course 
in Scotland. Working closely with the 
Scottish Environmental Protection Agency, 
the scheme involves the creation of a 
minewater treatment facility to remove 
iron and other pollutants from the 
Fordell Day Level, an old deep minewater 
drainage tunnel. The polluted minewater 
is pumped through water cascades and 
l a g o o n s 	 an d 	 fi l te r e d 	 t h r o u g h 	 o r g an i c 	
reed beds before being discharged back 
into its original course.

Environment Initiative, a partnership 
involving the local authority, conservation 
bodies and industry, working to enhance, 
promote and conserve the environment. 
This initiative has included the creation 
and enhancement of wildlife habitats 
and schools liaison amongst others.
People
The Group recognises that its people 
are the most valuable resource within 
the business and an open and challenging 
working environment is encouraged. 
ATH is committed to the training and 
development of its people to allow all 
s t af f	m e m b e r s	t o	f u l fi l	t h e ir	p o te n t i a l .	
The surface mining industry involves the use 
of large plant and machinery and the Group 
in v e s t s	s i g n i fi c an t	r e s o u r c e s	t o	e n s u r e	a l l	
operatives are properly trained to use the 
equipment safely and effectively. The Group 
undertakes an ongoing programme to 
monitor employee competency and each 
staff member has a tailored development 
and training plan to ensure that ATH remains 
an industry leader in employee competence.
Management training
During the year, the Group continued 
to focus on talent management and 
career development, with the objective 
of identifying the future managers 
of the business and providing them 
with the training and skills to develop. 
Career ladders have been created for 
all departments to provide a clear career 
progression plan for each team, setting 
o u t	t h e	e x p e c te d	qu a l i fi c at i o n s	an d	
anticipated experience required for an 
employee to be considered for promotion.
The Learning and Development Plan has 
am a l g am ate d	a l l	t h e	t r a in in g	i d e n t i fi e d	
during performance reviews. This plan 
provides cost effective, targeted training 
in order to develop the skills and capabilities 
of the Management of ATH.
Operational training
During the year, the Group continued 
to provide specialist training through the 
Mining Training School at the Grievehill 
restoration site. This School is responsible 
for all the new starter inductions and 
delivery of all the NVQ assessments. 
Conducting both the assessments and 
inductions on a restoration site ensures 
the highest standard of training is delivered 
in a safe environment under the close 
s u p e r v i s i o n	o f	a	qu a l i fi e d	t r a in e r	an d

achieved accreditation to continue

The high level of training capability 
has seen the school train 85% of the 
workforce to NVQ Level 2 standards 
on their primary piece of equipment, 
when combined with the large amount 
of tertiary training delivered to the 
workforce, means that ATH has one of 
t h e	b e s t	qu a l i fi e d	an d	m o s t	c o m p e te n t	
workforces within the industry.

Health and safety
A key strategic Group objective is to provide 
safe working environments for all employees 
and visitors at ATH mines and facilities.
Group health and safety policies 
and procedures are controlled through 
the ATH Resources plc Health and Safety 
Committee, chaired by the CEO responsible 
for health and safety. Health and safety is 
managed through the Health and Safety 
Assessment Model which drives Group 
performance through four key stages. 
The policy strives for continuous 
improvement through awareness, 
competence, compliance and excellence.
The Group provides ongoing high 
quality training to all employees in 
every aspect of health and safety and 
promotes an open culture where unsafe 
practices are challenged and reported 
to achieve our targets of excellence and 
continuous improvement. 
The Group had two reportable injuries 
during the year (2010: four) and suffered 
no major injuries. The Company has an

which recognised the quality of the processes 
for the management of health and safety 
within the Group.

of communication and interaction with 
our neighbouring communities to provide
