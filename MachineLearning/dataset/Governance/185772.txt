principles of Section 1 of the Combined
Code on Corporate Governance, which
is appended to the Listing Rules of 
the Financial Services Authority (the
Combined Code) and whether they
have complied with the Combined
Code' s provisions during the year.

Combined Code, with exception of 
the provisions relating to Directors'
service contracts. This report, together
with the Remuneration Report on pages
29 to 34 explain how the Group has
complied with the Combined Code.
The Board
The Board consists of three Executive
Directors, the Non-Executive Chairman
and four other Non-Executive Directors
1
,
all of whom are considered independent
of management and free from any
business or other relationship which
could materially interfere with 
the exercise of their independent
judgement. Following Rod Sellers'
resignation on 16 July 2002, 
Tim Howden became the Senior
Independent Director. Biographical
details for all current Directors and 
the Company Secretary are given 
on pages 24 and 25. There is a clear
division of responsibility between 
the Chairman, who leads the Board 
and the Chief Executive, who is
responsible for running the business.
Board meetings are scheduled for 
every other month and there is a 
formal schedule of matters reserved 
for its' approval, which include setting
strategy, annual and interim results,
annual budget and treasury policy,
major acquisitions, disposals, capital
expenditure and the monitoring of
operational and financial performance.
The Board has adopted a Code of
Practice which governs the calling 
of meetings, pre-circulation of papers,
review of Committee membership 
and terms of reference. 
The mix of skills and experience of the
Board ensures that matters are properly
debated and that no one Director or
group dominates the Board' s decision-
making process. Non-Executive
Directors are appointed for a specified
term. All Directors are subject to re-
election at the first AGM following 
their appointment and at least every
three years thereafter. 
The Company Secretary ensures that
Board procedures are followed and 
all Directors have access to his advice
and services. The Company will also
arrange for appropriate training and
induction for new Directors. From 
time to time updates are provided
covering developments on company
law, corporate governance and other
key areas.
A procedure exists for Directors to take
independent professional advice at the
Company' s expense in the furtherance
of their duties.

balanced assessment of the Group' s
position, and it reviews the system of
internal control and the effectiveness 
of the external and internal audit
process. T o perform its' function, the
Committee receives regular reports 
from both internal and external auditors.

with the provisions on the design 
of performance-related remuneration 
as set out in Schedule A of the
Combined Code.

strategic risks to which the Group may
be exposed and proposes appropriate
mitigation strategies to management. 
In addition it receives reports from 
the Head of Internal Audit on the
effectiveness of the risk management 
of process at Divisional level. The 
Audit Committee receives a report on
the operational effectiveness of the

Internal Control
The Board is responsible for the
maintenance of internal controls and
reviewing its effectiveness. This includes
financial, operational and compliance
controls, together with risk management.
The controls are designed to manage
rather than eliminate the risk of failure
to achieve business objectives and can
only provide reasonable and not
absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss. The Board has
established a process for internal control
which was in place throughout the
financial year under review and up 
to the date of approval of the Annual
Report and Accounts. SSL International plc 
Annual Report 2003

The Board reviews the effectiveness 
of the system of internal control at least
annually, and is confident that it
complies fully with the internal control
guidance for Directors in the Combined
Code. Key elements of the review include:
  Reviewing the updated Group and
Divisional risk matrices from the
RMC assisted by an ongoing review
of internal controls by the Internal
Audit function in line with the audit
plan agreed by the Audit Committee
and Group Finance Director;
  Ensuring Group policies and
procedures are in place for 
all areas considered at risk;
  Requiring a  Letter of Assurance'
from all statutory business units
within the Group, stating
compliance with Group policies,
identification of business risks 
and internal control confirmation;
  Consideration of reports from
internal and external audit on the
system of internal and material
control weaknesses;
  Ensuring each business unit
completes an updated Control Risk
Self Assessment, which are centrally
collated and reviewed; and
  Assessing the year end reporting
process throughout the Group
including visits to selected locations
by the Internal Audit function 
to assist in year end close and 
issue resolution.
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
There is Board level responsibility for
CSR matters. A CSR working group 
has been established and reports 
to the Leadership T eam.
Environment: A separate environment
report is being sent to shareholders and
is available on the corporate website.
Health and safety: The Group is
committed to ensuring employees
operate in a health and safety conscious
environment. The Group Health and
Safety department works closely with
management, staff and others.
Ethical: A revised ethics policy was issued
in October 2001 and requires staff to
behave ethically to all stakeholders.
Examples of further progress in the
Group' s relationships with stakeholders
are given in the Operating Review.
Going Concern
Having made appropriate enquiries, 
the Board is satisfied that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue 
in business for the foreseeable future.
Therefore, the going concern basis
continues to be appropriate in preparing
the financial statements.
Shareholder Relations
The Board recognises the importance 
of open communications with
institutional and private shareholders.
Institutional shareholders, fund
managers and analysts are briefed 
at presentations and regular meetings
with Executive Directors. In addition, 
the Board responds continually to 
ad-hoc requests for information from 
all shareholders. The AGM provides 
an opportunity for shareholders to 
raise questions with the Chairman 
and the Board.
The main source of information 
for the private investor is the Annual
Report and Accounts. Further investor
information, including copies of
previous Annual Reports and Accounts,
press releases, analyst presentations,
