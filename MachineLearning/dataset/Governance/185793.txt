 SSL International plc Annual Report 2004 22 Corporate Governance
Corporate Governance
Combined code
The Board is committed to high
standards of corporate governance.
Following the publication of the
new Combined Code on Corporate
Governance (the New Code) and
guidance on audit committees (the
Smith Guidance), the Board has
reviewed its corporate governance
procedures and is making changes
as appropriate. The New Code
applies to accounting periods
beginning on or after 1 November
2003. This report has been prepared
on the basis of the previous
Combined Code on Corporate
Governance (the Code), although
some additional disclosures have
been made. Throughout the year ,
the Company complied with the
Code with the exception of certain
provisions relating to Directors'
service contracts. This report,
together with the Remuneration
Report set out on pages 25 to 30,
explains how the Company has
applied the Code.
The Board
The Board consists of a Non-
Executive Chairman, four other 
Non-Executive Directors and three
Executive Directors. There is a clear
division of responsibility between
the Chairman, who leads the Board
and the Chief Executive, who is
responsible for running the
business. All of the Non-Executive
Directors are considered
independent of management and
free from any relationship which
could materially interfere with their
independent judgement. The
independence of Non-Executive
Directors has been considered
against the criteria of the New 
Code and it was determined that
each was independent, with the
exception of Tim Howden, the
Senior Non-Executive Director , who
has served for more than nine years. 
Mr Howden was appointed a Non-
Executive Director of Scholl PLC in
1994 and subsequently became a
Non-Executive Director of the
Company , following the merger
of Seton and Scholl in 1998. Mr
Howden will retire from the Board
at the forthcoming AGM. Subject
to his re-election by shareholders,
Peter Read will become the Senior
Independent Director .
The Board, which met seven 
times in the year , has a schedule 
of matters reserved for its approval,
including determination of strategy ,
the financial statements, annual
budget, treasury policy , major
acquisitions and disposals, capital
expenditure and monitoring 
of operational and financial
performance. There is an
established code of practice for
the calling of meetings and pre-
circulation of board papers. 
The Non-Executive Directors,
including the Chairman, meet
independently of management
on an occasional basis. 
All Directors joining the Board are
required to submit themselves for
election at the AGM following their
appointment and at least every
three years thereafter . Non-
Executive Directors are appointed
for a specified term. Details of the
current Directors appear on pages
20 to 21 . Details of changes to the
Board during the period are detailed
on page 24.
A procedure is in place for Directors
to receive independent professional
advice in respect of their duties.
They also have access to the
advice and services of the Company
Secretary . The Company Secretary
arranges for appropriate ongoing
training and an induction
programme tailored to meet the
needs of the individual. The
Directors receive regular updates
on changes and developments to
the business, legislative and
regulatory matters.
The mix of skills and experience
ensures that an effective Board
leads the Company and that no one
Director or group dominates the
Board' s decision making process.
Board committees
The Board has established three
committees. The terms of reference
of each committee are currently
being reviewed against the
criteria of the New Code and
will be updated as appropriate.
They will shortly be available on
the Company' s website: 
www.ssl-international.com
The Audit Committee is chaired by
Richard Adam and comprises all the
Non-Executive Directors
1
with the
exception of the Chairman who
resigned on 18 March 2004 (but
who has a standing invitation to
attend meetings). This committee
reports its findings to the Board.
Following each meeting, the Non-
Executive Directors met with
external auditors without
management present. The Audit
Committee is authorised to:
  Monitor the integrity of the
financial statements;
  Review the Company' s internal
financial controls and internal
control and risk management
systems;
  Review the effectiveness of the
Company' s internal audit
function; and
  Oversee the relationship with the
external auditor .
After making appropriate enquiries,
the Audit Committee is satisfied
as to the objectivity and
independence of the external
auditors - in particular , that
additional non-audit related
services does not threaten this
independence.
The Remuneration Committee
comprises all the Non-Executive
Directors and is chaired by Tim
Howden. Peter Read will become
Committee Chairman after Mr
Howden steps down at the
forthcoming AGM. The role of this
committee and details of how it
applied the principles of the Code
are set out in the Remuneration
Report on pages 25 to 30.
The Nomination Committee, which
is chaired by Peter Read, comprises
all the Non-Executive Directors and
the Chief Executive. This committee
makes recommendations for
appointments to the Board. 
In addition, the Executive T eam,
consisting of the Executive Directors
and certain senior executives are
responsible for the day-to-day
management of the Company .
The number of scheduled Board
meetings attended by each Director
during the year was as follows:

Internal control
The Board is responsible for the
Company' s system of internal
control and for reviewing its
effectiveness. The system of internal
control is designed to manage
rather than eliminate the risk of
failure to achieve business
objectives and can provide only
reasonable, and not absolute
assurance against material
misstatement or loss. Key elements
of the Company' s system of internal
control include:
  Regular Board meetings with 
a formal schedule of matters
reserved to the Board for
decision;
  The Company' s strategic
direction is regularly reviewed
by the Board;
  Clearly defined organisational
structures and appropriate
delegated authorities for the
Company' s businesses;
  Ensuring Company policies and
procedures are in place for all
areas considered at risk;
  Regular monitoring of
performance to assess progress
towards objectives;
  Procedures for control over
capital expenditure and
investments;
  Centralised treasury operations
operating within defined limits;
  Businesses are responsible for
meeting defined reporting
timetables and compliance with
Group accounting manuals
which set out accounting
policies, controls and definitions; 
  An effective Internal Audit
function providing independent
scrutiny of internal control
systems and risk management
procedures;
  Annual compliance statements
from all statutory business units
within the Company , stating
compliance with Company
policies, identification of
business risks and internal
control confirmation; and
  Assessing the year end reporting
process throughout the
Company including visits to
selected locations by the Internal
Audit function to assist in year
end close and issue resolution.
The Board reviews the effectiveness
of the system of internal control at
least annually , and is confident that
it complies fully with the Internal
Control: Guidance for Directors on
the Combined Code (the  T urnbull
Report'). The effectiveness of this
process has been reviewed by the
Audit Committee. Key elements of
the review include:
  Discussions with management
on risk areas identified by
management and/or the audit
process; 
  The review of internal and
external audit plans; and
  The review of significant issues
arising from the internal and
external audits.
Relations with shareholders
The Company has a programme
of communication with its
shareholders, including regular
meetings with, and presentations
to, institutional shareholders, fund
managers and analysts. The
Company website contains share
price information, copies of annual
reports, press releases and analyst
presentations.
The AGM provides an important
opportunity for shareholders to
raise questions with the Board.
Those shareholders whose shares
are held within Crest, the electronic
share settlement system will have
the opportunity to vote
electronically for this year' s AGM.
Instructions are given in the AGM
notice of meeting.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Board
has a reasonable expectation that
the Company and the Group have
adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the
foreseeable future. For this reason,
we continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the
financial statements.
