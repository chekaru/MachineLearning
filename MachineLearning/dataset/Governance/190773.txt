REl ATIONS wITH SHAREHOl DERS
The combined Chairman's Statement and Chief Executive's Report and the Financial Review on pages 4 to 9 include 
a detailed review of the business and future developments. Shareholders are encouraged to pose questions to the 
Board at any time of the year and the Board uses the Annual General Meeting to communicate with all shareholders 
and welcomes their participation. 
INTERNAl C ONTROl
The d irectors are responsible for establishing and maintaining the Group's internal control systems. Internal 
control systems are designed to meet the particular needs of the Group and the risk to which it is exposed, and 
by their nature can provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. The key 
procedures which the d irectors have established with a view to providing effective internal controls are as follows:
 	 C o r p o r a t e	A c c o u n t i n g	a n d	P r o c e d u r e s :
T h e r e	a r e	d e fi n e d	a u t h o r i t y	l i m i t s	a n d	c o n t r o l s	o v e r	a c q u i s i t i o n s	a n d	d i s p o s a l s .	T h e r e	a r e	a l s o	c l e a r	r e p o r t i n g	
lines within the business and risk assessments are undertaken and regularly reviewed in all divisions and at all 
levels within the Group. Appropriate internal controls are set for all divisions of the business. Given the size and 
nature of the Group, no separate internal audit department is considered necessary. 
 	 Q u a l i t y	o f	P e r s o n n e l :	
The competence of personnel is ensured through high recruitment standards and subsequent training courses. 
High quality personnel are seen as an essential part of the control environment.

proposals are submitted to the Board. Reviews are carried out after the acquisition is complete and any overruns 
are investigated. d ue diligence work is carried out if a business is to be acquired.
GOING CONCERN
The review of the Group's business activities is set out in the combined Chairman's Statement and Chief Executive's

risk management.
The Group's forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show 
that the Group should be able to operate within the level of the facilities and covenants over a period of at least twelve

and debt to fair value.
After making enquiries, the d irectors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Group therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in
