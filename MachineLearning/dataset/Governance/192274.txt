Principles of good governance
As an entity quoted on AIM, System C is not required 
to comply with the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance (the Code ). However, following the 
admission of its shares to AIM in 2005, the Company 
adopted many of the best practice provisions contained 
in the Code and continues to make considerable 
progress in improving its procedures in this respect.
The Board strongly believes in providing a framework 
for establishing good corporate governance and 
accountability and has identified the policies and 
procedures described below to support this approach.
The Board
The Board has ultimate responsibility and accountability 
for the Group's operations. During the year the Board 
comprised the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, 
the Sales and Strategy Director, the Finance Director 
and three non-executive Directors. The Chairman's 
role changed from an executive to a non-executive 
position on 1 September 2007. During the year 12 Board 
meetings, 2 Audit Committee meetings, 4 Remuneration 
Committee meetings and 2 Nomination Committee 
meetings were held. The Directors attended these 
meetings as follows:

The Board believes its current structure is appropriate for the scale of the business and enables the Group to be 
managed efficiently.
The specific responsibilities reserved to the 
Board include, but are not limited to:
   Setting strategy and approving an annual budget and 
medium-term projections;
  Reviewing operational and financial performance;
   Approving any acquisitions, divestments and material 
capital expenditure;
   Reviewing the Group's systems of financial control and 
risk management;
   Ensuring that appropriate management development 
and succession plans are in place;
   Reviewing the environmental, health and safety 
performance of the Group;
   Approving appointments to the Board and the 
Company Secretary; 
   Approving policies relating to Directors' remuneration 
and the severance of Directors' contracts; and 
   Ensuring that an appropriate and constructive 
dialogue takes place with shareholders. annual report and financial statements 2008 | System C 23
corporate governance statement
The Board has a procedure through which the Directors 
are able to take independent advice at the Company's 
expense in the furtherance of their responsibilities.
The Directors also have access to the advice and services 
of the Company Secretary. The Company Secretary 
is responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are 
followed and that applicable rules and regulations are 
complied with.
The Group has adopted a share dealing code for 
Directors and senior employees on the same terms as 
the Model Code appended to the Listing Rules of the  
UK Listing Authority.
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and 
independent Non-Executive Directors
Different individuals hold the posts of Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer and there is a clear division
of responsibilities.
The Chairman is responsible for leading the Board and 
ensuring its effectiveness.
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for running the 
business and for ensuring that accurate, timely and clear 
information is presented at the Board meetings or when 
otherwise appropriate.
The role of Chairman was an executive role throughout 
the year ended 31 May 2007 and up until 31 August 
2007, which was a departure from the Code in terms of 
the independence criteria outlined. As mentioned in the 
Annual reports of previous years the role of an executive 
chairman was deemed appropriate for a period following 
the admission of the Company's ordinary shares to AIM. 
The requirement for this role is no longer considered 
necessary and following recommendations from the 
Nomination Committee Jim Horsburgh assumed the role 
of a non-executive Chairman on 1 September  2007.
The Board is balanced by an appropriate non-executive 
element. All of the Non-Executive Directors, save for 
Dr Christopher McLaren by virtue of his significant 
interest in the ordinary shares and his longstanding 
involvement with the Company, are considered by the 
Board to be independent and have no relationships 
interfering with their independent judgment.  
The share options held by Jim Horsburgh and the 
additional performance related fees in relation to Dr 
John Forest and Thomas Chambers referred to on page 
28 are not in the Boards view of a nature or scale to 
impact their independence.
Professional development
The Chairman is responsible for the process to ensure 
that Directors keep their skills and knowledge up to 
date and to encourage their professional development. 
The Group ensures that adequate time and financial 
resources are available for Directors to attend 
appropriate training. New Directors are encouraged to 
participate in the Group's induction programme and to 
meet senior managers and staff. In addition, all Directors 
are encouraged to attend Company events and take a 
proactive role in informing themselves about the Group 
through a variety of means, including the intranet, 
newsletters, site visits, the business's events  
and attendance at appropriate stakeholder meetings.
Relations with shareholders
The Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Finance 
Director are the principal points of contact for investors, 
analysts, fund managers, media and other interested 
parties. Access is available to the Non-Executive 
Directors if this is required. Meetings with analysts and 
institutional investors are held following the interim and 
preliminary results announcements.
The Board are kept appraised about shareholder 
relations and have full access to reports from the 
Company's nominated adviser, Collins Stewart, and 
financial public relations advisors, Maitland Consultancy.

twice each year and otherwise as required.
The Remuneration Committee considers all material 
elements of remuneration policy, remuneration 
and incentives of executive Directors and senior 
management with reference to independent 
remuneration research and professional advice in 
accordance with the Combined Code.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for setting 
any performance criteria in relation to the exercise of 
options granted to the Executive Directors as referred to 
in the Directors' Remuneration Report.
No Director is permitted to participate in discussions 
or decisions concerning his own remuneration, and 
the remuneration of members of the Remuneration 
Committee shall be determined in accordance with good 
practice by the remaining Board members.
Details of Directors' service contracts are provided in the 
Directors' Remuneration Report.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is chaired by  
Dr John Forrest and also comprises 
Dr Christopher McLaren and Thomas Chambers.
The Nomination Committee has responsibility for 
considering the size, structure and composition of the 
Board, the retirement and appointment of Directors and 
will make appropriate recommendations to the Board in 
relation to these matters. The Nomination Committee 
meets formally as required.
Potential candidates to the Board are interviewed either 
by the Nomination Committee or a panel appointed by 
that Committee. An appointment requires final approval 
by the Board prior to an offer being forwarded.

Board Committees
The Board has established three committees to deal 
with matters in accordance with written terms of 
reference which are available on request from the 
Company Secretary. They are the Audit Committee, a 
Remuneration Committee and a Nomination Committee. 
A majority of the members of the Committees are 
independent Non-Executive Directors.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by Thomas Chambers 
and also comprises Dr Christopher McLaren and 
Dr John Forrest.
No members of the Committee have any links with 
System C's external auditors.
The Audit Committee formally meets two times per 
year and otherwise as required. The Audit Committee 
considers all matters relating to financial controls and 
reporting, internal and external audits, the scope 
and results of the audits, the independence and 
objectivity of the auditors and also keeps under review 
the effectiveness of the Company's controls and risk 
management. The ultimate responsibility for reviewing 
and approving the annual report and financial statements 
and interim statements remains with the Board. The 
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, other Directors and 
representatives from the finance function may attend and 
speak at meetings of the Audit Committee.
Details of the amounts paid to the external auditors 
during the year for audit and other services are set out in 
note 5 to the financial statements.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by 
Dr Christopher McLaren and also comprises 
Thomas Chambers and Dr John Forrest. 
Since the role of Chairman became a non-executive 
position, Jim Horsburgh may attend meetings conducted 
by the Remuneration Committee.

Internal control
In accordance with the guidance of the Turnbull 
Committee the Board accepts responsibility for the 
Group's system of internal control; sets appropriate 
policies on internal control; seeks regular assurance that 
enables it to satisfy itself that the system is functioning 
effectively; and ensures that the system of internal 
control is effective in managing risks in the manner which 
it has approved.
The Directors continue to review the effectiveness of 
the Group's system of financial and non-financial 
controls, including operational and compliance controls, 
risk management and the Group's high level internal 
control arrangements. These reviews include an 
assessment of internal controls and, in particular, internal 
financial controls.
The Board views the careful management of risk as a key 
management activity. Managing business risk to deliver 
opportunities is a key element of all activities. These 
business risks, which may be strategic, operational, 
reputational, financial or environmental, should be 
understood and visible.
The Board approves the Group's annual budget which 
is prepared in the context of the Board approved 
business plan. 
The Board receives monthly financial reports which 
assess performance in comparison with the annual 
budget and in relation to periodic re-forecasts. Key 
performance indicators are regularly reviewed at Board 
level and by senior managers responsible for key areas of 
the business.
The Group has implemented a whistle-blowing policy as 
part of its ongoing review of risk policies.
The Group does not currently have an internal audit 
function however the Board will consider the need to 
create one as the business grows.
