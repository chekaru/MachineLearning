Corporate Governance Statement
There is a commitment to high standards of Corporate
Governance throughout the Group. The Board confirms that
throughout the year ended 30 September 2008 the Group has
complied with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the 2006
Combined Code on Corporate Governance, except for clause
B1.6 in that two Executive Directors have service contracts which
provide for two years notice. The Board believes this is
appropriate to attract and retain key Executive Directors who
possess specialist industry knowledge and is therefore in the best
interests of shareholders.
The Board is accountable to the Company's shareholders for
good governance and the statement set out below describes how
the principles identified in the Combined Code (appended to the
Stock Exchange Listing Rules) are applied by the Company.
Directors
Details of the Directors who served during the year, the positions
they hold, and the committees of which they are members are
shown on page 4. During the year the Board consisted of a
Chairman, E.W. Dawnay, two additional Non-executive Directors
and three Executive Directors, of which H.W. Bovill is the
Managing Director. Of the Non-executive Directors the Board
considers E.W. Dawnay and P .A. Thorburn to be independent of
management and free of any relationship which could materially
interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement.
Neither have any significant interest in the shares of the
Company and both received a fixed fee for their services. The
Board is satisfied that the Chairman's other commitments do not
detract from the extent or the quality of the time which he is able
to devote to the Company. Following the year end, on 1 October
2008, J.R. Grace was appointed as a Non-executive Director of
the Company and is also considered to be independent of
management.
The Nomination Committee is responsible for the annual
evaluation of the Board, its committees and its Directors. The
Board is satisfied with the evidence it provided about the balance
and the effectiveness of the Board and its committees and the
effectiveness and commitment of each Director.
Biographies of the Board members appear on page 12. 
The Board meets at least five times each year and more
frequently where business needs require. The Board has a
schedule of matters reserved to it for decision and the
requirement for Board approval on these matters is
communicated widely throughout the senior management of the
Group. These include matters such as material capital
commitments, commencing or settling major litigation, business
acquisitions and disposals and appointments to subsidiary
company boards. 
There is an agreed procedure for Directors to take independent
professional advice if necessary and at the Company's expense.
This is in addition to the access which every Director has to the
Company Secretary. The Secretary is charged by the Board with
ensuring that Board procedures are followed.
When new members are appointed to the Board they are
provided with access to an appropriate external training course
and to advice from the Company's solicitors in respect of their
role and duties as a public company director. Where a new Board
member has significant relevant experience, training may be felt
to be unnecessary.
The differing roles of Chairman and Managing Director are
acknowledged and defined in separate statements approved by
the Board. The key functions of the Chairman are to conduct
board meetings, meetings of shareholders and to ensure that all
Directors are properly briefed in order to take a full and
constructive part in Board discussions. The Managing Director is
required to develop and lead business strategies and processes
to enable the Group's business to meet the requirements of its
shareholders.
The Senior Independent Director is E.W. Dawnay and concerns
relating to the executive management of the Company or the
performance of the other Non-executive Directors may be raised
with him.
To enable the Board to function effectively and Directors to
discharge their responsibilities, full and timely access is given to
all relevant information. In the case of board meetings, this
consists of a comprehensive set of papers, including regular
business progress reports and discussion documents regarding
specific matters.
Appointments to the Board of both Executive and Non-executive
Directors are considered by the Nomination Committee.
Members of the Nomination Committee throughout the year are
shown on page 4. The Nomination Committee consults with
Executive Directors when considering appointments and ensures
that a wide range of candidates are considered. The
recommendations of the Nomination Committee are ultimately
made to the full Board which considers them before any
appointment is made. The Remuneration Committee considers
any remuneration package before it is offered to a potential
appointee. 
Any Director appointed during the year is required, under the
provisions of the Company's Articles of Association, to retire and
seek election by shareholders at the next Annual General
Meeting. The Articles also require that one third of the Directors
retire by rotation each year and seek re-election at the Annual
General Meeting. The Directors required to retire are those in
office longest since their previous re-election and this usually
means that each Director retires at least every three years,
although there is no absolute requirement to this effect. In order
to comply with the Combined Code, but to avoid the expense of
amending the Company's Articles to deal with this single point,
the Board has resolved that each Director will retire at least every
three years, even if this is not strictly required by the Articles.
Furthermore, in line with the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance (Provision A.7.2), it is the Company's practice that
any Non-executive Director having been in post for nine years or
more is subject to annual re-election. 
Full details of the Directors' remuneration and a statement of the
Company's remuneration policy are set out in the Directors'
Remuneration Report appearing on pages 18 to 20. Members of
the Remuneration Committee throughout the year are shown on
page 4 and the principal terms of reference of the Committee
appear on page 16. The Managing Director attends meetings of Treatt plc Report & Financial Statements 2008

Corporate Governance Statement continued
the Remuneration Committee to discuss the performance of the
other Executive Directors and make proposals as necessary, but
is not present when his own position is being discussed.
Each Executive Director abstains from any discussion or voting at
full Board meetings on Remuneration Committee
recommendations where the recommendations have a direct
bearing on their own remuneration package. The details of each
Executive Director's individual package are fixed by the
Committee in line with the policy adopted by the full Board.
Board Committees
The Board has established a number of standing committees to
which various matters are delegated according to defined terms
of reference. The principal committees are the Nomination
Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Audit
Committee. The principal terms of reference for each Committee
are shown below.
Nomination Committee
To consider the appointment or retirement of Directors, to review
proposed nominations and make recommendations thereon to
the Board. 
Remuneration Committee
To determine the remuneration of the Executive Directors and the
Senior Executives of the Group.
Audit Committee
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee are as follows:
The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, reviews the
effectiveness of the system of internal control from information
provided by management and the Group's auditors. Any system of
internal control can only provide reasonable but not absolute
assurance of meeting the internal control objectives. 
The Audit Committee keeps the scope and cost effectiveness of the
external auditors under review. The independence and objectivity of
the external auditors is also considered on a regular basis, with
particular regard to the level of non-audit fees. The split between
audit and non-audit fees for the year under review appears in note 3.
The non-audit fees were paid mainly in respect of tax compliance
services. The current level of non-audit fees is considered by the
Committee not to affect independence or objectivity.
In accordance with C.3.4 of the Combined Code, the Audit
Committee is responsible for ensuring that procedures are in place
whereby staff of the Company may, in confidence, raise concerns
about possible improprieties in matters of financial reporting or
other matters. The Audit Committee has arrangements in place for
the proportionate and independent investigation of such matters
and for appropriate follow-up action.

them to attend in person.  
Communication
The Company places a great deal of importance on
communication with its shareholders. The Company mails to all
shareholders its full annual report and financial statements. This
information, together with the half yearly statements and other
financial announcements, is also available on the Group's
website and, upon request, to other parties who have an interest
in the Group's performance. Shareholders also have direct
access to the Company and the Company responds to letters
from shareholders and customers on a wide range of issues.
There is regular dialogue with individual institutional shareholders
as well as presentations after the interim and preliminary results.
All shareholders have the opportunity to put questions at the
Company's Annual General Meeting and the Company makes a
presentation at the meeting to highlight the key business
developments during the financial year.
