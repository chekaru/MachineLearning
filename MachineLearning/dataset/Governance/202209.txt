 The Group has, since admission to AIM in December 2001, applied principles of corporate governance commensurate with its size.
Directors
The Directors support the concept of an effective Board leading and controlling the Group. The Board is responsible for approving
the Group's policy and strategy. It meets on a regular basis and has a schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision.
Management supply the Board with appropriate and timely information and the Directors are free to seek any further information
they consider necessary. All Directors have access to advice from the Company Secretary and independent professional advice at
the Company's expense.
The Board consists of three executive Directors, who hold the key operational positions in the Group and three non-executive
Directors, who bring a breadth of experience and knowledge. This provides a balance whereby the Board's decision making 
cannot be dominated by an individual. The Chairman of the Board is N C Paul and the other non-executive directors are 
R Allsop and J Rubins. The Board approve the strategic decisions of the Group. The Group's business is run on a day to day 
basis by S W Cooper, M I Welburn and N Silverthorne with S W Cooper having overall responsibility as the Chief Executive.
Relations with shareholders
The Group values the views of its shareholders and recognises their interest in the Group's strategy and performance. The Annual
General Meeting will be used to communicate with private investors and they are encouraged to participate. The Directors will be
available to answer questions. Separate resolutions will be proposed on each issue so that they can be given proper consideration
and there will be a resolution to approve the annual report and accounts.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for maintaining a strong system of internal control to safeguard shareholders' investment and the Group's
assets and for reviewing its effectiveness. The system of internal control is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute,
assurance against material misstatement or loss.
An audit committee has been established comprising the non-executive Directors, chaired by J Rubins, which will meet at least
twice per annum and is responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the Group is properly monitored and reported
on as well as meeting the auditors and reviewing any reports from the auditors regarding accounts and internal control systems.
The Board has considered the need for an internal audit function but has decided the size of the Group does not justify it at
present. However, it will keep the decision under annual review.
Board structure
The key features of the Group's system of governance are as follows:
- the Group is headed by an effective Board, which leads and controls the Group;
- there is a clear division of responsibilities in running the Board and running the Group's business;
- the Board includes a balance of executive and non-executive Directors; and
- the Board receives and reviews on a timely basis financial and operating information appropriate to be able to discharge 
its duties.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the financial statements.
International financial reporting standards (IFRS )
The Board acknowledges that the London Stock Exchange (LSE) issued revised AIM rules in December 2005, which allows AIM
companies to continue to prepare their annual audited accounts in accordance with UK GAAP or IFRS. The Board is also aware
that the LSE have indicated that it will require AIM listed companies to use IFRS for accounting periods commencing on or after 
1 January 2007.
The Board have plans in place to publish their interim results for the six months to 30 September 2007 under IFRS, with
comparatives within the deadline for publication of the interim results.

The Board recognises that Directors' remuneration is of legitimate concern to the shareholders and is committed to following
current best practice. The Group operates within a competitive environment, performance depends on the individual contributions
of the Directors and employees and it believes in rewarding vision and innovation.
Policy on executive directors' remuneration
Detail of individual Directors' remuneration is set out in note 2 to the financial statements. The policy of the Board is to provide
executive remuneration packages designed to attract, motivate and retain Directors of the calibre necessary to maintain the
Group's position and to reward them for enhancing shareholder value and return. It aims to provide sufficient levels of
remuneration to do this, but to avoid paying more than is necessary and reflects the Directors' responsibilities. A separate
remuneration committee has been established comprising the non-executive Directors and is chaired by R Allsop.
Basic annual salary
The Remuneration Committee reviews each Executive Director's basic salary annually. In deciding upon appropriate levels 
of remuneration the Board believes that the Group should offer levels of base pay reflecting individual responsibilities and
commensurate with similar jobs in other business sectors.
