CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2012
DIRECTORS 
The Directors support the concept of an effective Board leading and controlling the Group. The Board is responsible for approving the 
Group's policy and strategy. It meets on a regular basis and has a schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision.  Management 
supply the Board with appropriate and timely information and the Directors are free to seek any further information they consider 
necessary. All Directors have access to advice from the Company Secretary and independent professional advice at the Company's 
expense.
The Board consists of three executive Directors, who hold the key operational positions in the Group, and two non-executive Directors, 
who bring a breadth of experience and knowledge. This provides a balance whereby the Board's decision making cannot be dominated  
by an individual. The Chairman of the Board is N C Paul CBE and the other non-executive director is R Allsop. The Board approves  
the strategic decisions of the Group. The Group's business is run on a day to day basis by M I Welburn, P Lee and D E Leakey with  
M I Welburn having overall responsibility as the Chief Executive.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The Group values the views of its shareholders and recognises their interest in the Group's strategy and performance. The Annual General 
Meeting will be used to communicate with private investors and they are encouraged to participate. The Directors will be available to 
answer questions. Separate resolutions will be proposed on each issue so that they can be given proper consideration and there will be a 
resolution to approve the annual report and accounts.
INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board is responsible for maintaining a strong system of internal control to safeguard shareholders' investment and the Group's assets 
and for reviewing its effectiveness. The system of internal control is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
An audit committee has been established comprising the non-executive Directors which is chaired by R Allsop. The committee meets at 
least twice per annum and is responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the Group is properly monitored and reported on 
as well as meeting the auditors and reviewing any reports from the auditors regarding the financial statements and internal control systems.
The Board has considered the need for an internal audit function but has decided the size of the Group does not justify it at present.  
However, it will keep the decision under annual review.
BOARD STRUCTURE
The key features of the Group's system of governance are as follows:
 - the Group is headed by an effective Board, which leads and controls it; 
 - there is a clear division of responsibilities in running the Board and running the Group's business; 
 - the Board comprises a reasonable balance between executive and non-executive Directors; and 
 - the Board receives and reviews on a timely basis financial and operating information appropriate to be able to discharge its duties.  14
TRICORN GROUP PLC 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2012
GOING CONCERN
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Detailed cash flow forecasts have been prepared which highlight that the Group has sufficient cash 
headroom to support its activities. The key assumptions in these forecasts have been sensitised and no issues arise which lead to any 
concern regarding the operations or financing of the Group. For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.
DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
The Board recognises that Directors' remuneration is of legitimate concern to the shareholders and is committed to following current best 
practice. The Group operates within a competitive environment, performance depends on the individual contributions of the Directors and 
employees and the Group believes in rewarding vision and innovation.
POLICY ON EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION
Detail of individual Directors' remuneration is set out in note 5 to the financial statements. The policy of the Board is to provide executive 
remuneration packages designed to attract, motivate and retain directors of the calibre necessary to maintain the Group's position and to 
reward them for enhancing shareholder value and return. It aims to provide sufficient levels of remuneration to do this, but to avoid paying 
more than is necessary and reflects the Directors' responsibilities. A separate remuneration committee has been established comprising 
the non-executive Directors and which is chaired by R Allsop.
BASIC ANNUAL SALARY
The Remuneration Committee reviews each executive Director's basic salary annually.  In deciding upon appropriate levels of 
remuneration the Board believes that the Group should offer levels of base pay reflecting individual responsibilities and which are 
commensurate with similar jobs in other business sectors.
ANNUAL BONUS PAYMENTS, BENEFITS AND PENSION ARRANGEMENTS
M I Welburn, P Lee and D E Leakey participate in a performance related bonus arrangement through Tricorn Group plc.
M I Welburn, P Lee and D E Leakey benefit from the provision of private medical insurance, the provision of company cars or car 
allowance and are eligible to participate in a contributory pension scheme.
R Allsop and N C Paul CBE receive no bonus, pension or benefits in kind.
NOTICE PERIODS
M I Welburn has a service agreement with the Company which is terminable on not less than 12 months' written notice given by either 
party to the other at any time. P Lee has a service agreement with the Company which is terminable on not less than six months' written 
notice given by either party to the other at any time. D E Leakey has a service agreement with the Company which is terminable on not 
less than three months' written notice given by either party to the other at any time.

given by either party.
