As a company listed on the Alternative investment Market of the London Stock exchange, t ricorn group plc is not required to comply with the 
full requirements of the uK Corporate governance Code. We do not therefore comply with the uK Corporate governance Code. however, 
we have reported on our Corporate governance arrangements by drawing upon best practice available, including those aspects of the uK 
Corporate governance Code we consider relevant to the group and best practice. 
direcT ors
the Directors support the concept of an effective Board leading and controlling the group. the Board is responsible for approving the group's 
policy and strategy. it meets on a regular basis and has a schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision. Management supply the 
Board with appropriate and timely information and the Directors are free to seek any further information they consider necessary. All Directors 
have access to advice from the Company Secretary and independent professional advice at the Company's expense.
the Board consists of three executive Directors, who hold the key operational positions in the group and two non-executive Directors, 
who bring a breadth of experience and knowledge. this provides a balance whereby the Board's decision making cannot be dominated by 
an individual. the Chairman of the Board is n C Paul CBe and the other non-executive director is R Allsop. the Board approve the strategic 
decisions of the group. the group's business is run on a day to day basis by M i Welburn, P Lee and D e Leakey, with M i Welburn having overall 
responsibility as the Chief executive.
relA Tions wiTh shAreholders
the group values the views of its shareholders and recognises their interest in the group's strategy and performance. the Annual general 
Meeting will be used to communicate with private investors and they are encouraged to participate. the Directors will be available to answer 
questions. Separate resolutions will be proposed on each issue so that they can be given proper consideration and there will be a resolution to 
approve the annual report and accounts.
inTernAl conTrol
the Board is responsible for maintaining a strong system of internal control to safeguard shareholders' investment and the group's assets and 
for reviewing its effectiveness. the system of internal control is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
An audit committee has been established comprising the non-executive Directors which is chaired by R Allsop. the committee meets at least 
twice per annum and is responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the group is properly monitored and reported on as well as 
meeting the auditors and reviewing any reports from the auditors regarding the financial statements and internal control systems.
the Board has considered the need for an internal audit function but has decided the size of the group does not justify it at present. however, 
it will keep the decision under annual review.
bo Ard sTrucTure
the key features of the group's system of governance are as follows:
 - the group is headed by an effective Board, which leads and controls the group;
 - there is a clear division of responsibilities in running the Board and running the group's business;
 - the Board includes a reasonable balance between executive and non-executive Directors; and
 - the Board receives and reviews on a timely basis financial and operating information appropriate to be able to discharge its duties.

GoinG concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. Detailed cash flow forecasts covering at least 12 months from the date that these accounts were approved 
have been prepared which highlight that the group has sufficient cash headroom to support its activities. the key assumptions in these forecasts 
have been sensitised and no issues arise which lead to any concern regarding the operations or financing of the group. for this reason, the 
Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
direcT ors' remunerATion
the Board recognises that Directors' remuneration is of legitimate concern to the shareholders and is committed to following current best 
practice. the group operates within a competitive environment, performance depends on the individual contributions of the Directors and 
employees and it believes in rewarding vision and innovation.
policy on execuTiVe direcT ors' remunerATion
Detail of individual Directors' remuneration is set out in note 5 to the financial statements. the policy of the Board is to provide executive 
remuneration packages designed to attract, motivate and retain Directors of the calibre necessary to maintain the group's position and to 
reward them for enhancing shareholder value and return. it aims to provide sufficient levels of remuneration to do this, but to avoid paying more 
than is necessary and reflects the Directors' responsibilities. A separate remuneration committee has been established comprising the non-
executive Directors and is chaired by R Allsop.
bAsic Annu Al sAlAr y
