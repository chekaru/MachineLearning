Vp plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Corporate Governance
The Board is accountable to the Company's shareholders for good governance and is committed to high standards of corporate
governance throughout the Group. The Board has prepared this report with reference to the UK Combined Code of Corporate Governance
(the Code ) issued by the Financial Reporting Council as revised in June 2006. The Board confirms that throughout the year ended 31
March 2009 the Company has been in compliance with all of the provisions of the Code.
DIRECTORS
The Board consists of three Executive Directors and three Non Executive Directors. The Non Executive Directors are considered by the Board
to be independent under the provisions of the Code on the basis that they are not members of management and they are free of any
business or other relationships that could materially interfere with, or reasonably be perceived to materially interfere with, the independent
exercise of their judgement. Peter Parkin is the senior independent Non Executive Director. The Chairman is an Executive Director. The
biographies of the Board members shown on page 14 indicate the high level and broad range of experience which the Board possesses.
Appropriate training for new and existing Directors is kept under review and provided where necessary.
THE BOARD
The role of the Board is to maximise the long-term performance of the Group through the implementation of strategies designed to
enhance shareholder value. The Board reviews strategy on a regular basis and exercises control over the performance of each operating
company within the Group by agreeing budgetary targets and monitoring performance against those targets.
The roles of the Chairman and Group Managing Director are separate and clearly defined. The Chairman runs the Board and sets the
strategic agenda for the Group. The Group Managing Director is responsible for the operational management of the Group's business.
The Board has five scheduled meetings each year and additional meetings are held as required. The Board has a schedule of matters
reserved for its approval, including major capital expenditure, significant investments or disposals and treasury policy. In certain areas,
specific responsibility is delegated to committees of the Board within defined terms of reference.
The Audit Committee has two scheduled meetings each year and the Remuneration and Nomination Committees each have one, with
additional meetings held as required.
During the year, all Directors attended the five Board meetings that were held. All of the members of the respective committees attended
the two Audit Committee meetings and the one Remuneration Committee meeting held during the year. The Nomination Committee met
once during the year to approve the appointment of Steve Rogers. The primary role of the Nomination Committee is to ensure that
appointments to the key leadership roles within the Group, particularly Board appointments, are made after due consideration of the
relevant and necessary skills, knowledge and experience of the potential candidates. In addition it considers succession planning in order
to ensure the continued ability of the Group to compete effectively in the market place.
The membership of the Committees appears on page 15. Copies of the terms of reference of the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations
Committees are available on the Company's web site at www.vpplc.com.
There is an agreed procedure for Directors to take independent professional advice at the Company's expense if deemed necessary for the
correct performance of their duties. The Company Secretary is charged by the Board with ensuring that Board procedures are followed.
The Board, having implemented improvements following a formal evaluation of its performance, its committees and that of the Chairman,
feels that there are no major issues requiring change, but will continue to evaluate performance on a regular basis and implement changes
as necessary. The evaluation was undertaken using a questionnaire prepared for the Board by Equity Culture, an independent consultant,
which drew on its experience of good practice across a range of listed companies.
To enable the Board to function effectively and assist Directors to discharge their responsibilities, full and timely access is given to all
relevant information. In the case of Board meetings, this consists of a comprehensive set of papers, including latest available management
accounts, regular business progress reports and discussion documents regarding specific matters. In addition, senior managers are
regularly invited to Board meetings and make business presentations to the Board. The evaluation of Board performance concluded that
the level of information made available to the Board was of appropriate quality and provided on a timely basis.
Any Director appointed during the year is required, under the provisions of the Company's Articles of Association, to retire and seek
reappointment by shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting. The articles also require that at least a third of Directors should retire
and seek re-election each year. Jeremy Pilkington and Peter Parkin shall retire by rotation and seek re-election by shareholders at the next
Annual General Meeting. Furthermore since Steve Rogers was appointed a Director since the last Annual General Meeting he is required
to retire and seek re-appointment. In addition Barrie Cottingham having served over ten years as a Non Executive Director will retire as a
Director at the Annual General Meeting. 24

Corporate Governance
Full details of Directors' remuneration and a statement of the Company's remuneration policy are set out in the Remuneration Report
appearing on pages 18 to 22. Each Executive Director abstains from any discussion or voting at full Board meetings, on the
recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, which have a direct bearing on his own remuneration package. Each Executive
Director's individual package is set by the Remuneration Committee in line with the policy adopted by the full Board.
COMMUNICATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS
The Board actively seeks and encourages engagement with major institutional shareholders and other stakeholders. The Chairman, Group
Managing Director and Group Finance Director attend brokers' and analyst presentations in relation to the Company's interim and full
year results and also meet fund managers, brokers, analysts and the media on a regular basis to discuss business strategy, results and
other issues. Presentation material used in these briefings is published on the Company's website www.vpplc.com. While the Non
Executive Directors do not ordinarily attend these meetings, they are available if required by stakeholders. Feedback from these meetings,
collated by Brewin Dolphin, is reviewed by the Board as a whole.
The Board encourages all shareholders to attend and ask questions at the Annual General Meeting which is attended by all the Directors.
The Board also actively encourages communication with employees and details of this are noted in the Directors' Report.
AUDIT
The primary role of the Audit Committee is to keep under review the Group's financial and other systems and controls and its financial
reporting procedures. In fulfilling this role, the Committee receives and reviews work carried out by the internal and external auditors. The
Company's internal audit department works to an annual programme developed in consultation with the Committee, as well as covering
specific matters arising during the year.
The Committee keeps the scope and cost effectiveness of both the internal and external audit functions under review. This includes a
regular review of the effectiveness of the external auditor.
The independence and objectivity of the external auditor is also considered on a regular basis, with particular regard to the level of non-
audit fees. The split between audit and non-audit fees for the year to 31 March 2009 and information on the nature of the non-audit
fees incurred appear in note 3 to the Financial Statements. The non-audit fees which were paid in respect of taxation and other advice
are considered by the Committee not to affect the independence or objectivity of the auditors. The external auditor's appointment is
subject to regular review by the Committee and the lead audit partner is rotated at least every five years. The Committee also maintains
a formal policy on the provision of non-audit services by the auditor, which is reviewed each year. This policy prohibits the provision of
certain services and requires that others are subject to prior approval by the Committee or its Chairman. All other permitted non-audit
services are considered on a case by case basis.
The Committee also receives an annual confirmation of independence from the auditor.
INTERNAL CONTROL
Throughout the year, the Group has been in full compliance with the applicable provisions on internal control contained in the Code.
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group's system of internal controls and risk management. The Audit Committee reviews and
monitors the system's effectiveness on behalf of the Board every six months and ensures that a thorough review in accordance with
Turnbull guidance is undertaken annually. The responsibility for the system rests with the Executive Directors. The system includes an
ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing significant business risks. The system can, however, only provide reasonable
and not absolute assurance of meeting internal control objectives.
The Audit Committee reports on its assessment to the Board, so that the Board can reach its own informed view on control effectiveness.
The Board confirms that it has reviewed the significant risks affecting the Group and has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of
internal controls in place during the year ended 31 March 2009 and through to the date of this report.
The Statement of the Directors' Responsibilities in relation to the accounts appears on page 27.
