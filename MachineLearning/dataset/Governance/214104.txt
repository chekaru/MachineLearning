Corporate governance report 
 
Introduction 
 
 The Board of directors is committed to high standards of corporate governance. 
 
The Board is accountable to its shareholders for good governance and the statement below is based on the review of 
corporate governance that was carried out by the Audit Committee and describes how the principles of good governance 
have been applied. 
 
Constitution of the Board 
 
During the year ended 30 June 2008, the Board was comprised of the following: 
 
Wolf Martinick - Chairman 
Rod Webster - Chief Executive Officer 
Paul Craven - Chief Financial Officer  
John Bryant - Non-executive director 
Peter Redmond  - Non-executive director  
 
On 10 July 2008, Peter Redmond resigned from the Board and Alan Stephens was appointed as a non-executive 
director. On 9 February 2009, Paul Craven resigned from the Board. 
 
Non-executive directors 
 
During the year, the Board had three non-executive directors: Peter Redmond and John Bryant, and Wolf Martinick who 
is also the Chairman of the Board.  Peter Redmond and John Bryant were considered to be independent , however due 
to the size of Wolf Martinick's holding of 4.75% and his ability to influence Ezenet Ltd's holding of 4.51%, he is not 
considered to be an independent director. Alan Stephens is also considered to be independent. 
 
Committees of the Board 
 
The Board has three standing committees, each of which has terms of reference setting out its authority and duties, as 
follows: 
 
The Audit Committee was made up of Peter Redmond as Chairman and John Bryant for the year ended 30 June 2008. 
 
The Audit Committee meets as required. It reviews the financial reports and accounts and the preliminary and interim 
statements, including the Board's statement on internal financial control in the annual report, prior to their submission to 
the Board for approval. The Audit Committee also reviews corporate governance within the group and reports on this to 
the Board. In addition, it assesses the overall performance of the external auditor including scope, cost effectiveness and 
objectivity. 
 
The Audit Committee is also charged with reviewing the independence of the external auditor and monitors the level of 
non-audit fees. These fees are disclosed in note 8 to the accounts. In the opinion of the Audit Committee, which has 
reviewed these fees and the procedures that Grant Thornton UK LLP have in place to ensure they retain their 
independence, the auditors' independence is not compromised. The Committee met three times during the period and 
John Bryant and Peter Redmond were present on all occasions. 
 
The Audit Committee can meet for private discussion with the external auditor, who attend its meetings as required.  The 
Company Secretary acts as secretary to the committee. 
 
Following the resignation of Peter Redmond from the Board, John Bryant became Chairman of the Audit Committee.   
While Mr Bryant does not have specific financial qualifications, the Board considers that the breadth and depth of his 
experience at Board level and his knowledge of the company's business makes him extremely well qualified for this role, 
and the work of the Audit Committee is in no way compromised. Additionally, the auditor is able to provide further 
specialist support when requested.  
 
The Board believes, however, that the Audit Committee would be strengthened with the addition of another non-
executive director with specific financial experience.   
 
The Remuneration Committee was made up of John Bryant as Chairman and Peter Redmond during the period, with the 
Company Secretary serving as secretary. 
 
The Remuneration Committee determines, on behalf of the Board, the group's policy on executive remuneration and the 
remuneration packages for executive directors. It also approves and administers the executive share option scheme, the  WEATHERLY INTERNATIONAL PLC

long term incentive plan (LTIP) and the grant of options as part of the remuneration package. The Committee met five 
times during the period, with John Bryant and Peter Redmond in attendance on each occasion.  
 
The Nominations Committee was made up of Peter Redmond and John Bryant during the period. 
 
In addition to its role of considering the appointment of directors and senior managers, the Nominations Committee is 
also charged with reporting to the Board on the effectiveness of the Board, its sub-committees and its directors, and it 
does this at the end of the annual audit cycle. The Committee did not meet formally during the year. The appointment of 
Alan Stephens as a non-executive director involved all members of the Board, which also sought independent advice 
before making the appointment.  
 
Since the period ended, the constitution of these three standing committees has been changed. For the current year, the 
Audit Committee will be made up of John Bryant (Chairman) and Alan Stephens; the Remuneration Committee will be 
made up of Alan Stephens (Chairman) and John Bryant; and the Nominations Committee will be made up of Wolf 
Martinick (Chairman) and Rod Webster with either Alan Stephens or John Bryant.  
 
Prior to the end of the reporting period, the Board had not nominated a senior independent non-executive director in line 
with the Quoted Companies Alliance Guidance. This was remedied at the Board meeting on 10 October 2008 when John 
Bryant was nominated as the senior independent non-executive director. At the same Board meeting, the directors also 
adopted the guidance on Corporate Governance for AIM Listed Companies by the Quoted Company Alliance and in 
future will be reporting our performance against the guidance. 
 
The relatively small number of share options that have been granted to the non-executive directors do not, in the opinion 
of Weatherly's advisers or its directors, impair their independence. 
 
Attendance at meetings 
 
Directors' attendance at meetings of the Board and its sub-committees during the period was as follows: 
 
Wolf Martinick - Board       8 of 16  
Rod Webster - Board     14 of 16 
Paul Craven - Board     16 of 16 
Peter Redmond  - Board     15 of 16   Audit Committee 3 of 3     Remuneration Committee 5 of 5 
John Bryant - Board     15 of 16   Audit Committee 3 of 3    Remuneration Committee 5 of 5 
 
During the year there were six scheduled Board meetings with a technical session for the directors on the preceding day. 
These technical sessions were attended by all the directors with the exception of Peter Redmond for the June session. 
There were a number of Board meetings called at short notice during the year when the company was formally in an 
offer period. During this period a sub-committee of the board was appointed and met frequently. This sub-committee 
reported to the Board, thus increasing the number of unscheduled Board meetings. There were no meetings of the 
Nominations Committee during the period. 
 
Internal control 
 
The Board is responsible for reviewing and approving the adequacy and effectiveness of the group's internal controls, 
including financial and operational control, risk management and compliance. 
 
In order to establish effective procedures for internal control and communicate this throughout the group, including its 
subsidiaries, the Board has issued two important documents to all staff known as the Board Protocol and the Manual of 
Internal Control. 
 
The key elements of the group's internal control are set out in these documents, and contain: 
  a clearly defined structure for the group, its subsidiaries and management teams; 
  powers which the Board has reserved to itself. These include the approval of all business plans and budgets for the 
group and all its subsidiaries, the establishment of subsidiary companies and appointment of directors to them, and 
the process for project approval and capital expenditure; 
  terms of reference for the Audit and Remuneration Committees, which define the roles of its directors; 
  information about how often the Board should meet (as a minimum) and an annual cycle of meetings. This covers the 
process for the preparation of Board agendas, Board papers and their prior consideration by the management team 
at its weekly meetings; 
  detailed business plans and budgets to be approved annually and performance monitored by the management team 
and the Board at its monthly meetings; and 
  procedures for the approval of expenditure, the levels of authority and the management controls.

The directors acknowledge their responsibility for the group's system of internal financial control and risk management, 
and place considerable importance on maintaining this. The Manual of Internal Control and the process for authorisation 
that it imposes, together with the Board Protocol setting out the process for authorising business plans, budgets and 
projects, form an important part of our decision making process; however, this can only provide reasonable and not 
absolute assurance against material errors, losses or fraud. 
 
There is currently no internal audit function within the group owing to the small size of the administrative function.  
However, there is a high level of review by directors and a clear requirement for them to authorise transactions. Should 
the need for a separate internal audit function become apparent, the Board will establish one. 
 
The Board Protocol and the Manual of Internal Control will continue to be updated and refined as Weatherly's business 
evolves and grows. In the difficult period prior to refinancing, there was an understandable disruption to normal 
administration but greater emphasis will be placed moving forward on maintaining a formal cycle of meetings and the 
timely production of documentation. 
 
Relations with shareholders 
 
The company endeavours to maintain regular communications with shareholders through regulatory announcements, via 
the Weatherly International website and by direct contact with its major shareholders. The Board values the views of its 
shareholders and fosters continuing dialogue with investment and fund managers, other investors and equity analysts to 
ensure that the investing community receives an informed view of the group's prospects, plans and progress.
