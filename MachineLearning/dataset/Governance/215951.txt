 We have audited the financial statements of 
William Ransom & Son plc for the year ended 
31 March 2006 which comprise the consolidated profit
and loss account, the consolidated and Company balance
sheets, the consolidated cash flow statement, the
statement of total recognised gains and losses and the
related accounting policies and notes. These financial
statements have been prepared under the accounting
policies set out therein. We have also audited the
information in the Directors' Remuneration report 
that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company's
shareholders, as a body, in accordance with Section
235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has
been undertaken so that we might state to the
Company's shareholders those matters we are
required to state to them in an auditors' report and 
for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted
by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the Company and the Company's
shareholders as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of 
directors and auditors
The directors responsibilities for preparing the Annual
Report, the Directors' Remuneration Report and the Group
financial statements in accordance with applicable law
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards are set out
in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements
and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report 
to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and
regulatory requirements and International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the
financial statements give a true and fair view and
whether the financial statements and the part of the
Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited have
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the
Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we
have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit, or if information specified by
law regarding directors' remuneration and other
transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual
Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the
audited financial statements. The other information
comprises only the Directors' Report, the unaudited
part of the Directors' Remuneration Report, the Chairman's
Statement, the Operating and Financial Review and
the Corporate Governance Statement. We consider the
implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies
with the financial statements. Our responsibilities 
do not extend to any other information.

We report to you whether in our opinion the information
given in the Directors' Report is consistent with the
financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination,
on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements and the part of
the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited. It
also includes an assessment of the significant estimates
and judgements made by the directors in the preparation
of the financial statements, and of whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group's 
and Company's circumstances, consistently applied
and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain
all the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence
to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements
and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to
be audited are free from material misstatement, whether
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming
our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the financial statements
and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to
be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion;
  the financial statements give a true and fair view,
of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company
as at 31 March 2006 and of the Group's profit for
the year then ended;
  the financial statements and the part of the Directors'
Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act
1985; and
  the information given in the Directors' Report is
consistent with the financial statements.
