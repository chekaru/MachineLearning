economic environment in which the entity operates (the 
 functional currency') The consolidated accounts are

and presentation currency Transactions in currencies other than the functional 
currency are recorded at the rates of e change prevailing 
on the dates of the transactions At each balance sheet

overseas operations are translated at e change rates 
prevailing on the balance sheet date Income and e pense 
items are translated at the average e change rates for 
the period unless e change rates uctuate signi cantly

providing bene ts is determined using the Pro ected Unit 
Credit Method with independent actuarial valuations being 
carried out at each balance sheet date Actuarial gains and 
losses are recognised in full in the period in which they 
occur They are recognised outside the income statement 
and presented in the statement of comprehensive income 
and e pense Past service cost is recognised immediately to the e tent 
that the bene ts are already vested and otherwise is 
amortised on a straight line basis over the average period 
until the bene ts become vested The retirement bene t obligation recognised in the balance 
sheet represents the present value of the de ned bene t 
obligation as ad usted for unrecognised past service cost 
and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets Any 
asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past 
service cost plus the present value of available refunds and 
reductions in future contributions to the plan Short term compensated absences
A liability for short term compensated absences such as 
holiday is recognised in trade and other payables for the 
amount the Group may be re uired to pay as a result of the 
unused entitlement that has accumulated at the balance 
sheet date Segment reporting
During the period covered by this report the Group managed 
its business primarily by reference to business segments The 
four reported business segments are UK and Ireland Middle 
East and North Africa (MENA) Eastern Europe (EE) and Rest 
of the World (RoW) Share-based payments
The Group issues e uity-settled payments to certain 
employees E uity-settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value at the date of grant The fair value 
determined at the grant date of the e uity-settled share-
based payments is e pensed on a straight line basis over 
the vesting period based on the Group's estimate of shares 
that will eventually vest The fair value of share options is measured by use of an 
appropriate nancial model The e pected life used in the  
model has been ad usted based on management's best 
estimate for the effects of non-transferability e ercise 
restrictions and behavioural considerations  63 WYG REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2012
Financial instruments
Financial assets and nancial liabilities are recognised on the 
Group's Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at 
their amortised cost as reduced by appropriate allowances for 
estimated irrecoverable amounts A provision for impairment is 
established where there is ob ective evidence that the Group 
will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the 
original terms of the receivables The amount of the provision 
is recognised in the income statement Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing ban loans and overdrafts are recorded at the 
proceeds received net of direct issue costs Finance charges 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and 
direct issue costs are accounted for on an accrual basis in the 
income statement and are added to the carrying amount of 
the instrument to the e tent that they are not settled in the 
period in which they arise 
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their 
amortised cost Equity instruments
E uity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the 
proceeds received net of direct issue costs E uity instruments 
include preference shares issued as part of the capital 
restructuring since in accordance with IAS 32 the Group has 
the contractual right to delay redemption inde nitely and has 
no contractual re uirement to pay preference dividends Capital risk management
The Group's ob ectives when managing capital are to 
safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern 
in order to provide returns for shareholders and bene ts for 
other sta eholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure 
to reduce the cost of capital In order to maintain or ad ust 
the capital structure the Group may ad ust the amount of 
dividends paid to shareholders return capital to shareholders 
issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt The ey element of capital managed by the Group is its li uid 
cash resources and these are monitored on a daily basis The Group is sub ect to a number of restrictions from its 
lenders as to the amounts of cash that are held in certain 
 urisdictions and outside the security of the lender group 
Dividend distribution
Dividend distribution to the Company's shareholders is 
recognised as a liability in the Group's accounts in the  
period in which the dividends are approved by the  
Company's shareholders 
Project claims
Pro ect claims can be made as a conse uence of disputes or 
shortcomings in pro ect delivery and could impact upon the 
results of the Group It is embedded in the Group's culture 
that client relationships are developed so as to ensure client 
satisfaction owever it is recognised that pro ect claims are 
possible and that these ris s cannot completely be eliminated 
In the event that such claims arise in common with others 
operating in the sector the Group has established professional 
indemnity insurance policies that are intended to protect 
against signi cant losses Signi cant judgements and key sources of  
estimation uncertainty
The preparation of the accounts re uires the Group to ma e 
estimates udgements and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and e penses 
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  
 
The Directors base their estimates on historical e perience and 
various other assumptions that they believe are reasonable 
under the circumstances the results of which form the basis 
for ma ing udgements about the carrying value of the assets 
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
Actual results may differ from these estimates under different 
assumptions or conditions Areas of udgement and sources of estimation uncertainty that 
have the most signi cant effect on the amounts recognised in 
the nancial statements are Revenue recognition and the assessment of the percentage 
of contract completion achieved The Group assesses 
contract progress and determines the proportion of 
contract wor completed at the balance sheet date in 
relation to the total contract wor s
 Review of asset carrying values and impairment charges 
The Group performs impairment testing in accordance 
with the accounting policy described within the signi cant 
accounting policies in the notes to the accounts The 
calculation of recoverable amounts re uires the use of 
estimates and assumptions consistent with the most recent 
budgets and plans that have been formally approved by 
management (see notes 11 and 1 )
