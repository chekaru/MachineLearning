Corporate Governance 
 
Throughout the year the board remained accountable to the company's shareholders for 
maintaining standards of corporate governance. The following is an explanation of the 
measures taken by the company. 
 
The board of directors 
 
The board held ten scheduled meetings during the year.  Additional meetings were held 
where it was considered appropriate or where business needs required. In addition, 
meetings of committees of the board were held when required. The board had a schedule 
of matters reserved for its decision. 
 
The board determines the company's strategic objectives and key policies, and approves 
the business plans for the company, interim and final financial statements, 
recommendations of dividends, significant investment and major new business proposals, 
as well as significant organisational matters and corporate governance arrangements. 
There are clear levels of delegated authority, which enable management to take decisions 
in the normal course of business. 
 
All new directors, where applicable, received an induction and training on joining the 
board, including information about the company and their responsibilities, meetings with 
key managers, and visits to the company's operations. There is an agreed procedure for 
directors to take independent professional advice at the company's expense in furtherance 
of their duties in relation to board or committee matters. Directors have access to the 
company secretary who is responsible for ensuring that board procedures are followed. 
The directors receive full and timely access to all relevant information, including a monthly 
board pack of operational and financial reports. Direct access to key executives is 
encouraged. The company has directors' and officers' liability insurance in place. 
 
At the end of the year, the Yorkshire Water board comprised a non executive chairman, 
five executive directors and eight further non executive directors. 
  
The board has delegated certain authority to board committees as and when appropriate.  
The company does not have its own remuneration, nominations or audit committees but 
these are operated at group level by Kelda Holdings Ltd, the company's ultimate parent 
company. 
 
Kelda Holdings Ltd audit committee 
 
Roger Hyde, who is an independent non executive director, sits on the Kelda Holdings Ltd 
audit committee and four group directors comprise the balance of the committee.  The 
external auditors, the head of internal audit and the company secretary attend all 
meetings. The group finance and regulation director attends by invitation. The committee 
also meets with the external auditors without the presence of executive management when 
it considers it necessary or appropriate to do so. The committee chairman reports on the 
activities of the committee to the group board meeting immediately following each 
committee meeting.

The audit committee's key tasks include: 
 
  reviewing and monitoring of the integrity of the annual financial statements; 
  reviewing the company's system of internal control, including financial, operational, 
compliance and risk management; 
  overseeing the company's relationship with the external auditors, agreeing the nature 
and scope of the audit and reviewing the independence and objectivity of the external 
auditors; and 
  monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the internal audit function. 
 
In undertaking these tasks the committee receives and reviews work carried out by the 
internal and external auditors and their findings. Both the internal and external auditors 
work to an annual plan developed in consultation with the committee. In addition, the 
committee reviews specific business areas and processes from time to time.  
 
The regular business of the audit committee includes consideration of reports on financial 
statements, audit planning, the activities of internal audit and its key findings, and the 
consideration of the operation of internal control processes.  
 
The independence and objectivity of the external auditors is considered on a regular basis, 
with particular regard to the level of non audit fees. 
 
The group has adopted an auditors independence policy which establishes procedures 
and guidance under which the company's relationship with its external auditor is governed 
so that the audit committee is able to satisfy itself that there are no factors which may, or 
may be seen to, impinge upon the independence and objectivity of the audit process. 
 
Internal control 
 
An ongoing process, in accordance with the guidance of the Turnbull Committee on 
internal control, has been established for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
significant risks faced by the company and this has been in place for the year under review 
and up to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts. Strategic, financial, 
commercial, operational, social, environmental and ethical risks fall within the scope of this 
process. The process is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to 
achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.  
 
The company has comprehensive and well defined control policies with clear structures, 
delegated authority levels and accountabilities. 
 
The company's risk management process aims to be comprehensive, systematic and 
continuous, and based on constant monitoring of business risk. The key features of the 
process include the following: 
  The main risks facing the company are identified and recorded in a strategic risk 
register together with the control mechanisms applicable to each risk. These are 
collated from risk registers maintained by individual businesses; 
  There is clear allocation of management responsibility for risk identification, recording, 
analysis and control; 
  The audit committee reviews the effectiveness of the systems which are in place and 
reports to the group holding company board; 
  An established risk management forum, chaired by the group company secretary 
operated during the year.  This was in transition to passing responsibility for risk to  Corporate Governance Report

operational business units throughout the group, reporting to the audit committee via 
the executive team; 
   Business units are required to report annually on principal business risks and the 
operation of control mechanisms; and 
  The internal audit department provides objective assurance and advice on risk 
management and control, and monitors the risk management process. 
 
The audit committee reviews and monitors the effectiveness of the process on behalf of 
the group holding company board.  
 
In addition to this process, the business is subject to: a quarterly comprehensive review by 
the executive team; independent internal and external audits which were reported to the 
executive team and the audit committee; an extensive budget and target-setting process; a 
quarterly reporting and forecasting process reviewing performance against agreed 
objectives; appropriate delegated authority levels; established financial policies and 
procedures; and other risk management policies and procedures such as health and 
safety and environmental policies. 
 
Environment  
 
The environmental policy of the company recognises that a sustainable water and waste 
water business is dependent on environmentally sustainable operations. It is therefore 
committed to integrating environmental best practice and continuous improvement in 
environmental performance through the efficient, effective and proper conduct of its 
business.  
 
Environmental performance is reported through the company's website which is regularly 
updated.  This can be viewed at www.yorkshirewater.com/our-environment.aspx.  
 
Community 
 
The company contributes actively to the communities which it serves.  It encourages and 
supports colleagues in volunteering, charitable giving and community involvement.  One in 
three employees is active in a wide range of supported community activities. These 
include a Speakers' Panel and support to local education ranging from governor 
appointments, and Right to Read in junior schools through to coaching at senior schools 
and mentoring university students from diverse ethnic backgrounds. 
 
Going concern 
 
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation, given the nature of 
the regulated water services business, that the company has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.  For this reason, they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
