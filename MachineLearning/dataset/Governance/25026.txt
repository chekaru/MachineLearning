CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
PRINCIPLES OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The policy of the Board is to manage the affairs of the Company in accordance with the principles underlying
the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
The Board of Directors is accountable to shareholders for the good corporate performance of the Company.
The principles of Corporate Governance and a code of best practice are set out in the Combined Code. Under
the rules of the AIM, the Company is not required to comply in full with the code nor to state whether it
derogates from it. The Board considers that full compliance with the Code is not appropriate at this stage and
this statement sets out how the principles of the Code have been applied having regard to the size and nature
of the Company.
BOARD STRUCTURE
The chief executive of the Company is William Hindmarch. He is heavily involved in the day to day running
of the Company. In total the Board comprises a chief executive, one further executive Director and four Non-
executive Directors. William Henbrey and Colin Hargrave are independent non-executive Directors. It is
considered that this gives the necessary mix of industry specific and broad business experience necessary for
the effective governance of the Company.
There are certain matters specifically reserved to the Board for its decision. Board meetings are held on a
regular basis and effectively no decision of any consequence is made other than by the Board. All Directors
participate in the key areas of decision making, including the appointment of new Directors.
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the proper management of the Company. A statement of
Directors' responsibilities in respect of the accounts is set out on page 7. The non-executive Directors have
a particular responsibility to ensure that the strategies proposed by the executive Directors are fully
considered.
To enable the Board to discharge its duties, all Directors have full and timely access to all relevant
information.
All Directors have access to the Company Secretary. There is no agreed formal procedure for the Directors
to take independent professional advice at the Company's expense.
All Directors submit themselves for re-election at the annual general meeting at regular intervals. The non-
executive Directors are appointed under fixed term contracts of no more than one year.
A brief biography of each of the Directors is set out below.

NOMINATION COMMITTEE
There is no separate nomination committee at the moment due to the size of the Board.
INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROL
The Board acknowledges its responsibility for establishing and monitoring the Company's systems of
internal control. Although no system of internal control can provide absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss, the Company's systems are designed to provide the Directors with reasonable
assurance that problems are identified on a timely basis and dealt with appropriately.
The Company maintains a comprehensive process of financial reporting. The annual budget is reviewed and
approved before being formally adopted. Other key procedures that have been established and which are
designed to provide effective control as follows:
- Management structure - The Board meets regularly to discuss all issues affecting the Company.
- Investment appraisal - The Company has a clearly defined framework for investment appraisal and
approval is required by the Board where appropriate.
The Board regularly reviews the effectiveness of the systems of internal control and considers the major
business risks and the control environment. No significant deficiencies have come to light during the period
and no weakness in internal financial control have resulted in any material losses, contingencies which would
require disclosure as recommended by the guidance for Directors on reporting on internal financial control.
The Board considers that in light of the control environment described above, there is no current requirement
for a separate internal audit function.
