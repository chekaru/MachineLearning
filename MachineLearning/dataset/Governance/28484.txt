Pension costs
The pension costs summarised above of  4 5,000 ( 004,   7 ,000) relate to the Group's defined contribution and defined benefit 
pension arrangements. 
Defined contribution plans
The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit plans for all qualifying employees.
The total cost charged to income of   97,000 ( 004,   7 ,000) represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates 
specified in the rules of the schemes.  As at  December  005, contributions of   4,000 ( 004,   ,000) due in respect of the current 
reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit plan
A subsidiary company operates a defined benefit scheme for some staff.  Accrual of benefits ceased in  997, with the scheme now being 
operated as a closed fund.  A full actuarial valuation was carried out as at  January  004 and updated to  December  005 by a 
qualified independent actuary.
At the date of the last completed independent actuarial valuation, which was  January  004, the market value of the assets of the 
scheme was   59,000.  The actuary advised that at that date the actuarial valuation of the assets of the scheme was sufficient to cover 
69% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected increases in earnings.  The scheme is actuarially valued 
every three years.  The next valuation of the scheme will be as at  January  007.
Contributions are paid by the employer as and when required to cover any expenses of the scheme. In addition, contributions paid to 
the scheme during the year were   8,000 ( 004,  nil).
The Group's policy is to fund the deficit in the scheme by additional contributions to meet the scheme's commitment to members.
The major assumptions used by the actuary for the update were as follows:

number of Ordinary Shares in issue of 7 , 4,0 4 ( 004, 70,84 ,6 7). The diluted earnings per share has been calculated by reference to a 
weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue of 7 ,49 ,58 ( 004, 7 , 5,05 ) which takes account of share options and awards 
under the Group's Performance Share Plan.
