BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEWS FINANCIAL REVIEW
The specific items set out below did not impact 2009, but were
recognised in the comparative years.
A  64m charge in 2007 incurred in respect of property
rationalisation costs.
Charges of  53m in 2008 and  30m in 2007, were recognised in
relation to further estimated costs required to create Openreach
and deliver the Undertakings agreed with Ofcom, particularly
with regard to the introduction of equivalence of input systems.
Charges of  74m in 2008 and  65m in 2007 were recognised as
a result of the completion of a review of circuit inventory and
other working capital balances.
Profit on the sale of associates of  9m in 2008 and  22m in
2007. In 2008, the  9m profit arose from the receipt of
contingent consideration from the disposal of the group's
interest in e-peopleserve. In 2007, the  22m profit arose from
the disposal of 6% of the group's equity interest in the associate
Tech Mahindra Limited.
In 2008, the group agreed an outstanding tax matter relating to
a business disposed of in 2001, the impact of which was a tax
credit of  40m, and this closed all open items in relation to the
settlement reached in 2007. In 2007, the group agreed the
settlement of substantially all open UK tax matters relating to ten
tax years up to and including 2004/05 with HM Revenue and
Customs (HMRC). In 2007, the total impact of the settlement was
a net credit of  1,067m, comprising a tax credit of  938m
representing those elements of the tax charges previously
recognised which were in excess of the final agreed liability,
interest income of  139m and operating costs of  10m,
representing the costs associated with reaching this agreement.
A tax credit of  154m was also recognised in 2008 for the re-
measurement of deferred tax balances as a result of the change
in the UK statutory corporation tax rate from 30% to 28%,
effective in 2009.

In 2009, net finance expense before specific items was  620m
(2008:  378m, 2007:  233m). The net finance income associated
with the group's defined benefit pension obligation of  313m was
 107m lower than in 2008, which in turn was at the same level as
in 2007. The interest on pension scheme liabilities and expected
return on pension scheme assets reflects the IAS 19 assumptions
and valuation as at the start of the financial year. This is expected to
be a net interest cost of about  275m in 2010 as a result of the
significant reduction in asset values during 2009.
Interest on borrowings was  935m in 2009 (2008:  822m,
2007:  728m). The increase of  113m in 2009 reflects higher net
debt mainly due to lower free cash flow being exceeded by
dividend and share buy back payments. The increase in 2008 of
 94m reflects higher net debt and higher interest rates on variable
rate borrowings. Losses arising on derivatives not in a designated
hedge relationship was  29m in 2009 (2008:  41m, 2007:  4m).
In 2008, losses on derivatives not in a designated hedge
relationship of  41m included a charge of  26m on a low cost
borrowing transaction which was marginally earnings positive after
tax in the year. BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEWS

BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEWS FINANCIAL REVIEW
Interest income arising from listed investments and other interest
and similar income was  31m in 2009 compared with  65m in 2008
reflecting lower levels of investments held by the group and lower
average interest rates on deposits. In 2008, the reduction in
interest income of  14m reflects the lower level of investment
holdings following their utilisation to fund bond maturities.
Adjusted operating profit represented 2.6 times net finance
expense before specific items and the net finance income
associated with the group's defined benefit pension obligation,
which compares with interest cover of 3.6 times in 2008 and
4.2 times in 2007. The reduction in cover was largely due to lower
operating profits in the year and higher borrowing costs. Interest
cover of reported operating profit represented 0.7 times net
finance expense in 2009 (2008: 6.2 times, 2007: 27.0 times).
Associates and joint ventures
The results of associates and joint ventures before specific items are
shown below:
2009 2008 2007
 m  m  m
Share of post tax profit (loss) 
of associates and 
joint ventures 39 (11) 15
Our share of the post tax profit (loss) from associates and joint
ventures was a profit of  39m in 2009 (2008:  11m loss, 2007:
 15m profit). Our most significant associate is Tech Mahindra
Limited, which contributed  33m of post tax profit in 2009
(2008:  11m loss, 2007:  21m profit). The profits in 2009 reflect a
focus on efficiency and costs. The loss in 2008 reflects Tech
Mahindra's investment in the expansion of its global capabilities
during the year.
Profit before taxation
Adjusted profit before taxation was  1,877m in 2009, compared
with  2,506m in 2008 and  2,495m in 2007. The reduction in
2009 is primarily due to the unacceptable performance in BT Global
Services, partially offset by good performance in the other lines of
business. In 2008, adjusted profit before taxation was broadly flat
year on year, with the increase in operating profit being largely
offset by the increase in net finance expense.
Reported loss before taxation was  134m in 2009, compared with
profit before taxation of  1,976m in 2008 and  2,484m in 2007.
Taxation
The tax credit for 2009 was  53m and comprised a tax credit of
 10m on the profit before taxation and specific items and a credit
of  43m on specific items. The effective rate of the tax credit on the
profit before taxation and specific items was (4.2)%, reflecting the
tax credit arising on the contract and financial review charges of
 1.6bn (see page 10) recorded in the year.
The net tax charge in 2008 was  238m and comprised a charge
of  581m on profit before taxation and specific items, offset by a
tax credit of  343m on certain specific items. The net tax credit in
2007 was  368m and comprised a charge of  611m on profit
before taxation and specific items, offset by a tax credit of  41m on
certain specific items and a further specific tax credit of  938m
arising on settlement of substantially all open UK tax matters
relating to ten tax years up to and including the 2004/05 year. 
Earnings per share
Adjusted basic earnings per share were 18.4p in 2009, compared
with 23.9p in 2008 and 22.7p in 2007, reflecting the reduced
profitability. In 2009, the reported basic loss per share was 1.1p
(2008: earnings per share 21.5p, 2007: earnings per share 34.4p).

Reported diluted (loss) earnings per share were not materially
different from reported basic (loss) earnings per share in any year
under review.
Dividends
The Board recommends a final dividend of 1.1p per share (2008:
10.4p per share, 2007: 10.0p per share) to shareholders, amounting
to approximately  85m (2008:  805m, 2007:  825m). This will be
paid, subject to shareholder approval, on 7 September 2009 to
shareholders on the register on 14 August 2009. When combined
with the 2009 interim dividend of 5.4p per share, the total dividend
proposed for 2009 is 6.5p per share, totalling  503m (2008:
 1,236m, 2007:  1,247m). This compares with 15.8 pence in 2008
and 15.1 pence in 2007, a decrease of 59% following the increase in
2008 of 5%.
Dividends paid in 2009 were  1,222m (2008:  1,241m, 2007:
 1,053m) and have been presented as a deduction to shareholders'
equity.
Financing
In 2009, cash generated from operations was  4,934m (2008:
 5,187m, 2007:  5,245m), a reduction of 5% compared with
2008. In 2008, cash generated from operations included pension
deficiency payments of  320m.
In 2009, the group paid net tax of  228m, compared with a net tax
refund of  299m received in 2008. The net refund received in 2008
included a receipt of  521m in relation to the settlement of open tax
years up to and including 2004/05, together with tax paid of  222m.
In 2007, the group paid net tax of  35m, which included the initial
cash receipt of  376m in relation to the settlement with HMRC. In
2009, net cash inflow from operating activities was  4,706m (2008:
 5,486m, 2007:  5,210m).
