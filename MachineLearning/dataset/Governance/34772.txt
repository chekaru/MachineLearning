 2 Bunzl plc
Corporate governance
The Company is committed 
to high standards of corporate
governance and supports and 
has complied throughout 2003
with the principles contained in 
the combined code on corporate
governance ( the Code') applicable
for the year ended 31 December
2003 and which are annexed to
the Financial Services Authority's
Listing Rules. Following the
publication of the Higgs Report 
on non-executive directors and the
Smith Report on audit committees
the Code has been amended. The
revised Code will be effective for
the 2004 financial year. The Board
will continue to review its policies
and procedures in light of the
revised Code.
The Board
The Board currently comprises three
executive and six non-executive
directors all of whom have wide
experience and, apart from 
Mr A P Dyer, are considered by
both the Board and the criteria
set out in the Higgs Report to 
be independent. Brief biographical
details of the directors are given 
on pages 18 and 19 of the Annual
Review and Summary Financial
Statement. The Board met nine
times during 2003. Information
relating to the conduct of Board
meetings and the procedures
implemented to ensure that the
Board retains overall control and
accountability for all strategic,
financial, operational and compliance
issues are set out in the internal
control report below and in the
Financial Review on pages 20
and 21 of the Annual Review and
Summary Financial Statement. 
The Board has Audit, Remuneration
and Nomination Committees
which comply with the provisions
of the Code. The Chairman, 
Mr A J Habgood, continues to act
in the capacity of Chief Executive.
The Board recognises the concerns,
expressed in a general context,
about the possible negative
effects of a concentration of power
through a combined Chairman and
Chief Executive role but believes
these do not presently apply 
to the Company for a variety 
of reasons. The Board has 
a majority of independent 
non-executive directors who
constitute the entire membership
of the Audit and Remuneration
Committees and represent a
majority of the Nomination
Committee. None of the Company's
non-executive directors had any
previous connection with the
Company or its executive directors
on appointment to the Board. In
addition, the Group's operations
are devolved and the Group
benefits from the presence of
strong senior line management 
in those operations. The Deputy
Chairman, Mr A P Dyer, is a
former non-executive Chairman
of the Company. Mr J F Harris
has been designated as the senior
independent non-executive director.
The Board's firm view is that the
Group does not suffer from a
damaging concentration of power
and is well protected from such a
possibility. Furthermore, it believes
that the current arrangements
are in the best interests of the
business and of shareholders.
The Company has instigated a
formal Board evaluation process
overseen by the Deputy Chairman,
Mr A P Dyer. This includes
completion of self-assessment
forms by, and individual
discussions with, each director.
Detailed information concerning
directors' remuneration is given 
in the Directors' Remuneration
Report on pages 32 to 37.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee
comprises all of the non-executive
directors, with the exception of 
Mr A P Dyer, each of whom is
independent, and is chaired by 
Mr C A Banks. The Committee
met on five occasions during 
the year. Further details of the
Remuneration Committee, 
the Company's remuneration
policy and how it is applied 
are set out in the Directors'
Remuneration Report on 
pages 32 to 37. The terms 
of reference of the Committee 
are available on the 
Company's website.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises 
all of the non-executive directors,
with the exception of Mr A P Dyer,
each of whom is independent, 
and is chaired by Mr J F Harris
who is considered by the Board 
to have recent and relevant financial
experience. The Committee met
four times during 2003. It receives
and considers reports from the
external auditors and the internal
audit function. The Committee 
also reviews and approves the 
level and type of non-audit work
which the external auditors perform,
including the fees paid for such
work, thus ensuring that their
objectivity and independence is not
compromised. The Committee's
terms of reference are available 
on the Company's website.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee
comprises Mr A J Habgood, 
who chairs the Committee, 
and Mr A P Dyer, Mr S G Williams, 
Mr J F Harris and Mr C A Banks.
The Committee meets as
necessary to enable it to make
recommendations to the Board 
on new appointments of executive
and non-executive directors. The
Committee met once during the
year. The terms of reference of 
the Committee are set out on 
the Company's website.
Relations with shareholders
The Chairman and Finance
Director have regular meetings
with representatives of institutional
shareholders and report to the Board
the views of major shareholders.
Additional forms of communication
include presentations of the 
interim and preliminary results. 
All shareholders are encouraged 
to participate in the Annual General
Meeting, are invited to ask questions
at the Meeting and are given the
opportunity to meet the directors
informally. Notice of the Annual
General Meeting is sent to
shareholders at least 20 working
days before the Meeting. 
Internal control
The directors acknowledge that
they have overall responsibility for
the Group's system of internal
control and for reviewing its
effectiveness. However, such a
system is designed to manage
rather than eliminate the risk of
failure to achieve business
objectives and can only provide
reasonable and not absolute
assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
In 1999 the Turnbull Committee
published guidance on the wider
aspects of internal control. In
accordance with this guidance 
the Company established the
procedures necessary to ensure
that there is an ongoing process
for identifying, evaluating and
managing significant risks to the
Group. The Board confirms that
such procedures have been 
in place for the year ended 
31 December 2003 and up to 
the date of approval of these
financial statements and have
been reviewed during the year.
The Board meets regularly
throughout the year and has formally
adopted a schedule of matters
which are required to be brought 
to it for decision. This ensures that
the directors maintain overall control
over all significant strategic, financial,
operational and compliance issues.
The Board has delegated to
management the responsibility 
for establishing a system of
internal control appropriate to 
the business environments in
which the Group operates. 
The principal features of this
system include: 
  a procedure for monitoring 
the effectiveness of the internal
control system through a tiered
management structure with clearly
defined lines of responsibility and
delegation of authority to the
appropriate level of management;
  clearly defined authorisation
procedures for capital investment
and acquisitions;
  strategic plans which are prepared
annually by the business areas
and approved by the Board; Bunzl plc  3
  comprehensive budgets which
are prepared annually by the
business areas and approved 
by the Board;
  formal standards of business
conduct (including a code 
of ethics) based on honesty,
integrity and fair dealing;
  a well established consolidation
and reporting system for the
statutory accounts and monthly
management accounts; and
  a detailed procedures manual
covering treasury operations. 
Some of the procedures carried
out in order to monitor the
effectiveness of the internal 
control system are listed below:
  central management holds
regular meetings with business
area management to discuss
strategic, operational and financial
issues including a review of 
the significant risks affecting
each of the business areas 
and the policies and 
procedures by which these
risks are managed;
  an Executive Committee,
consisting of the Chairman and
the Finance Director and other
functional managers, meets
twice per month and reviews 
the outcome of the discussions
held at business area meetings
on internal control issues;
  the Board in turn reviews the
outcome of the Executive
Committee discussions on
internal control issues which
ensures a documented and
auditable trail of accountability;
  actual results are reviewed
monthly against budget,
forecasts and the previous 
year and explanations obtained
for all significant variances;
  the Group's bank balances
around the world are monitored
on a weekly basis and
significant movements are
reviewed centrally;
  the internal audit department
periodically reviews individual
businesses and procedures,
makes recommendations to
improve controls and follows 
up to ensure that management
implement the recommendations
made. The internal audit
department's work is determined
on a risk assessment basis 
and their findings are reported 
to Group and business 
area management;
  the external auditors are engaged
to express an opinion on the
financial statements. They review
and test the system of internal
financial control and the data
contained in the financial
statements to the extent
necessary for expressing their
audit opinion on the truth and
fairness of the financial statements;
  every six months the Audit
Committee, which is chaired 
by Mr J F Harris, the senior
independent non-executive
director, reviews the findings 
of the external and internal
auditors and approves the 
future work plans of the internal
audit function;
  regular meetings are held with
insurance and risk advisers 
to assess the risks throughout
the Group;
  the Group Health and 
Safety Committee sets relevant
policies on health and safety
issues, based on the special
advice of the Technical 
Sub-Committee, and monitors
their implementation;
  risk assessments, safety audits
and a regular review of progress
against objectives established 
by each business area are
periodically carried out;
  the Group Environment
Committee periodically reviews
environmental practices across
the Group; and
  developments in tax, 
treasury and accounting are
continually monitored by Group
management in association 
with external advisers. 
The directors confirm that they
have reviewed the effectiveness 
of the system of internal control 
in operation during 2003.
