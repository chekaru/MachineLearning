 Corporate Governance
The Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority require listed companies to
disclose how they comply with the principles of good governance and code of
best practice known as the Combined Code. This statement, which
incorporates the statement on corporate social responsibility, explains how
the Company has applied the principles of good governance set out in Section
1 of the Combined Code and complied with the Code of Best Practice.
The Board
During the year Business Post has maintained an equal balance of executive
and non-executive directors. Biographical details of all directors are set out in
the Directors and Advisers statement. Of the five non-executive directors, two
are judged to be independent according to the guidelines set out by the
Association of British Insurers. All the non-executive directors make a
significant contribution to the functioning of the Board and its committees, and
no one individual or group dominates the Board's decision-making process.
Although the Combined Code recommends that a majority of non-executive
directors should be independent, the Board believes that it has maintained an
appropriate balance of directors, bringing a wide range of skills and
experience to the Board.
All directors are required by the Company's Articles of Association to submit
themselves for re-election at least every three years. The names of those
directors standing for re-election to the Board this year are set out in the
Notice of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
The Board's focus is on strategy formulation, policy and control. There is a
formal schedule of matters reserved for decision by the Board which retains all
major operational and risk management decisions with the Board.
These include the approval of major items of expenditure or commitment,
including acquisitions; major operational projects, including new contract
wins; financing, including lease/buy decisions and the use of derivatives and
insurance; and changes in policy relating to the franchise network. The Board
routinely monitors the various financial, operational and commercial risks
facing the Company through reports from management.
The Chairman is primarily responsible for the working of the Board, and the
Chief Executive for the running of the business and implementation of Board
strategy and policy. The Board meets formally at least 9 times a year, with
other meetings as necessary. The Board receives reports in advance of each
meeting from the Chief Executive and Finance Director addressing the
financial performance of the Company and developments since the previous
meeting, with further reports on particular issues as appropriate. All directors
have access to the advice and services of the company secretary, and there is
a procedure whereby directors, wishing to do so in the furtherance of their
duties, may take independent professional advice at the Company's expense.
In addition, detailed reports are provided to the Board on a monthly basis to
enable the Board to discharge its duties.
The Board has a number of committees, the principal ones being the audit,
remuneration and nomination committees. Each of these committees operates
within written terms of reference. The audit committee comprises
Dennis Clark, chairman and senior independent non-executive director, Richard
Saville, the other independent non-executive director, and Peter Kane, the non-
executive Chairman. Its duties include the review of the half year and annual
financial statements, including significant financial reporting judgements
contained in them, before submission to the Board; the review of the
Company's internal financial control system through reports from management
and internal and external auditors; and the review of the scope and
effectiveness of the Company's internal audit function. It is also responsible
for the selection of the external auditors, the assessment of the scope and
results of the external audit and its cost effectiveness, and the independence
and objectivity of the external auditors. Details of the remuneration committee
are set out in the Remuneration Report. The nomination committee comprises
Dennis Clark, chairman, and the other non-executive directors. The committee
makes recommendations to the Board of new Board appointments, whether
executive or non-executive. Approval of all appointments is a matter for the
Board as a whole.
Directors' Remuneration
Details of directors' remuneration are set out in the Remuneration Report.
Relations with Shareholders
The Company values its dialogue with both institutional and private investors
while carefully recognising statutory constraints concerning the disclosure of
information. Two-way communication with institutional investors, analysts
and private investors is actively pursued, and a series of presentations and
meetings are held through the year. Feedback from these meetings is collated
by the Company's advisers and circulated to the Board to keep them informed
concerning the views of shareholders.
This year's Annual General Meeting will be held on 10 July 2003 at which time
the chairmen of the audit, remuneration and nomination committees will be
available to answer shareholder questions. The Company will continue its
practice of proposing individual resolutions, including separate resolutions
relating to the Directors' Report and Accounts and the Remuneration Report.
Report & Accounts 17 Accountability and Directors' Responsibilities
Company law requires the directors to prepare accounts for each financial year
which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and
Group and of the profit of the Group for that period.
After making due enquiries, the directors are satisfied that the Company and
the Group have adequate resources to continue in business for the foreseeable
future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in
preparing the accounts.
In preparing the accounts, the directors are required to: select suitable
accounting policies and then apply them consistently; make judgements and
estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and state whether applicable
accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the accounts.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
Company and Group and enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with
the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the
assets of the Company and Group and for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Board of directors has overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group
maintains a system of internal control to provide it with reasonable assurance
regarding effective and efficient operations, internal financial control and
compliance with laws and regulations. There are inherent limitations in any
system of internal control and, accordingly, even the most effective system can
provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance.
The maintenance and integrity of the Business Post Group plc website is the
responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the auditors does not
involve consideration of those matters and accordingly, the auditors accept no
responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial
statements since they were initially presented on the website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other
jurisdictions.
The Turnbull report issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England
and Wales in September 1999 provided further guidance as to how the
Combined Code principle on internal control should be applied in practice.
The Board considers that the Company has complied with the Turnbull report
throughout the year. There is a formal ongoing process for identifying,
managing and reviewing any changes in the risks faced by the Company.
This process operates under the direction of, and is regularly reviewed by, the
Board.
The key features of the internal control system within the Group are:
  clearly defined delegation of responsibilities, including relevant
authorisation levels,
  clearly documented internal procedures set out in operational and
administration manuals,
  regular compliance audit visits to all owned and franchised locations
which monitor compliance with procedures and assess the integrity of
financial information,
  review of financial procedures by the internal auditor,
  close personal involvement of executive directors in monitoring and
managing the main risk areas of the business,
  regular information provided to senior management, covering financial
performance and key business indicators, and
  monthly monitoring of results against budget and forecast, with major
variances being followed up and management action taken where
necessary.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the internal control systems
during the period covered by the accounts. This review covered all controls,
including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management.
Details of the Group's activities in relation to its environmental, employment
and health and safety responsibilities are set out in the Corporate Social
Responsibility statement.
Compliance with the Combined Code
With the exception of the number of non-executive directors judged to be
independent, the Board considers that the Company has complied with the
provisions of Section 1 of the Code of Best Practice throughout the financial
year.
