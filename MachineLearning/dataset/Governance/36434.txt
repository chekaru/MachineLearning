Corporate Governance Statement 
 
This Corporate Governance Statement forms part of the Directors' Report

The Board of the Company is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance and bases its 
actions on the principles set out in the Code issued by the Financial Reporting Council ( FRC') in September 
2012 (the  Code'). The Code can be found on the FRC's website at www.frc.org.uk  
This statement describes how the Group applies the principles of the Code. On 20 December 2011 the 
Company's listing category on the London Stock Exchange was transferred from  Premium Listing' to 
 Standard Listing'. Although companies with a standard listing are subject to less stringent corporate 
governance requirements, the Board has decided that the Group will continue to govern itself in accordance 
with the principles of the Code and explain why it has chosen not to comply with any of the provisions of the 
Code. 
During the year under review, the Group has complied with the Code's provisions with the following 
exceptions: 
  Code provision A.4.2 - During the year, the Chairman did not hold meetings with the non-executive 
Directors without the executives present 
  Code provision E.1.1 - The Senior Independent Director has not attended meetings with major 
shareholders 
The reasons for these two areas of non-compliance are as follows: 
  Although the Chairman did not hold formal meetings of the non-executive Directors during the year, 
regular discussions took place by telephone and email. 
  The Senior Independent Director, Mr Lehmann, did not attend meetings with major shareholders as 
this responsibility was undertaken by the Chairman and the Executive Directors. Mr Lehmann is 
available to shareholders who have concerns that they feel would be inappropriate to raise via the 
Chairman or Executive Directors. 
Board 
The Board provides leadership and oversight. The Board comprises a non-executive Chairman, Chief Executive 
Officer, Chief Operating Officer and two independent non-executive Directors. The membership of the Board 
and biographical details for each of the Directors are incorporated into this report by reference and appear on 
page 21. 
As at the date of this report, the Chairman had no significant commitments that might affect his ability to 
allocate sufficient time to the Company to discharge his responsibilities effectively. 
Under the Company's Articles of Association, all Directors must seek re-election by members at least once 
every three years. However, the Board has agreed that all Directors will be subject to annual election by 
shareholders, as recommended by the Code in respect of FTSE 350 companies. Accordingly, all members of 
the Board will be standing for re-election at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 23 June 2014. 
The Board has a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for it to decide, including approval of 
acquisitions and disposals, major capital projects, financial results, Board appointments, dividend 
recommendations, material contracts and Group strategy. Five Board meetings took place during 2013. 
The Chairman, in conjunction with the Company Secretary, plans the programme for the Board during the 
year. The agenda for Board and Committee meetings is considered by the relevant Chairman and issued with 
supporting papers during the week preceding the meeting. For each Board meeting, the Directors receive a 
Board pack including detailed monthly management accounts, briefing papers on commercial and operational 
matters and major capital projects including acquisitions. The Board also receives briefings from key 
management on specific issues. The attendance of those Directors in place at the year end at Board and 
Committee meetings during the year was as follows:  CADOGAN PETROLEUM PLC

A procedure exists for the Directors, in the furtherance of their duties, to take independent professional 
advice if necessary, under the guidance of the Company Secretary and at the Company's expense. All 
Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary, who is responsible to the 
Chairman for ensuring that Board procedures are complied with and that applicable rules and regulations 
are followed. 
Board independence 
The roles and responsibilities of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separate. A formal division of 
each individual's responsibilities has been agreed and documented by the Board. Mr Lehmann is the Senior 
Independent Director. 
The non-executive Directors bring an independent view to the Board's discussions and the development of 
its strategy. Their range of experience ensures that management's performance in achieving the business 
goals is challenged appropriately. The three non-executive Directors, Messrs Furst, Lehmann and Testa, are 
considered by the Board, in accordance with the Code, to be independent. The letters of appointment for 
the independent non-executive Directors are available for review at the Registered Office and prior to the 
Annual General Meeting. For information regarding the Annual General Meeting please refer to the Notice 
of Meeting on pages 99 to 104. 
Responsibilities and membership of Board Committees 
The Board has agreed written terms of reference for the Nomination Committee, Remuneration Committee 
and Audit Committee. The terms of reference for all three Board Committees are published on the 
Company's website, www.cadoganpetroleum.com, and are also available from the Company Secretary at 
the Registered Office. A review of the terms of reference, membership and activities of all Board 
Committees is provided on pages 33 to 37. 
Board performance evaluation 
Principle B.6 of the Code recommends that boards undertake a formal and rigorous annual evaluation of its 
own performance and that of its committees and individual directors. The Board is mindful that it needs to 
continually monitor and identify ways in which it might improve its performance and recognises that board 
evaluation is a useful tool for enhancing a board's effectiveness. For the year ended 31 December 2013, the 
Board opted to undertake self-evaluation by way of a questionnaire designed specifically to assess the 
strengths of the Board and identify any areas for development. 
The process was led by Mr Furst as Chairman and the evaluation of the Chairman's performance was led by 
Mr Lehmann as the Senior Independent Director. The Board discussed the evaluation questionnaire 
findings, which were also used by the Nomination Committee in its annual assessment of the Board's 
composition. The Directors are committed to ensuring that the Board continues to represent a broad 
balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge and that there is sufficient diversity within the 
composition of the Board. All appointments are made on merit against objective criteria - which include 
gender and diversity generally - in the context of the requirements of the business and the overall balance 
of skills and backgrounds that the Board needs to maintain in order to remain effective.

Internal control 
The Directors are responsible for the Group's system of internal control and for maintaining and reviewing 
its effectiveness. The Board has delegated responsibility for the review of the Group's internal controls to 
the Audit Committee. The Group's systems and controls are designed to safeguard the Group's assets and 
to ensure the reliability of information used both within the business and for publication. 
Systems are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives 
and can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
The key features of the internal control systems which operated during 2013 and up to the date of signing 
the accounts are documented in the Group's Corporate Governance Policy Manual and Finance Manual. 
These manuals have been circulated throughout the Group. In addition, the Company's joint venture 
entities adopted policies that mirror the Company's own, except WGI, where ENI's policies are adopted. 
Day-to-day responsibility for the management and operations of the business has been delegated to the 
Chief Executive Officer and senior management. 
Certain specific administrative functions are controlled centrally. Taxation, treasury and insurance functions 
report to the Director of Group Finance who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer. The legal 
function is managed by the General Counsel who reports to the Board and also attends all Board meetings. 
The Health and Safety and Environment functions report to the Chief Operating Officer. An overview of the 
Group's treasury policy is set out on page 13. 
The Group does not have an internal audit function. Due to the small scale of the Group's operations at 
present, the Board do not feel that it is appropriate or economically viable to have this function in place. 
The Audit Committee will continue to consider the position annually. 
The Board has reviewed the process, which has been in place from the start of the year to the date of 
approval of this report and which is in accordance with revised guidance on internal control published in 
October 2005 (the  Turnbull Guidance'). During the course of its review of the risk management and 
internal control systems, the Board has not identified nor been advised of any failings or weaknesses which 
it has deemed to be significant. Therefore a confirmation in respect of necessary actions has not been 
considered appropriate. 
Relations with shareholders 
The Chairman and Executive Directors of the Company have a regular dialogue with analysts and 
substantial shareholders. The outcome of these discussions is reported to the Board and discussed in detail. 
Mr Lehmann, as the Senior Independent Director, is available to shareholders who have concerns that they 
feel would be inappropriate to raise via the Chairman or Executive Directors. 
The Annual General Meeting is used as an opportunity to communicate with all shareholders. In addition, 
financial results are posted on the Company's website, www.cadoganpetroleum.com, as soon as they are 
announced. The Notice of the Annual General Meeting is contained in this report on pages 99 to 104. It is 
intended that the Chairmen of the Nomination, Audit and Remuneration Committees will be present at the 
Annual General Meeting. The results of all resolutions will be published on the Company's website, 
www.cadoganpetroleum.com.
