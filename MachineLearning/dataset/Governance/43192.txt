provided by the external auditor, and considered opportunities

Significant financial judgements
The Committee considered the following significant issues 
regarding the financial statements:
  whether the attribution of the Company's business operations 
to Cash Generating Unit's (CGU) was appropriate, supported 
by management and financial reporting structures and whether 
the carrying value of Goodwill and Intangibles was supported 
by appraised values in use under a range of future 
operating conditions;
  the determination of revenue for the year and in particular the 
determination and age profile of debtors and the valuation of 
work-in-progress;
  the carrying value of deferred tax balances in the light of 
the expected geographic distribution of the Company's 
taxable profits;
  the funding position of the Company's defined benefit pension 
schemes, in comparison with comparable schemes, and the 
primary assumptions on which the valuations were based; and
  the availability and term of the Company's financing 
arrangements together with its future cash flow projections and 
sensitivity of the same to different economic and operating 
conditions and assessed whether the going concern basis 
of accounting was appropriate for the Company's 
financial statements.
Auditor re-appointment
The Company's audit services have been provided by Deloitte LLP 
since the Company's floatation in 1996 with regular audit partner 
rotations. The lead audit partner was last changed by rotation in 
2010. The Committee undertook an external tender for Group 
audit during 2013 and received submitted tenders from three audit 
firms; the current auditor, Deloitte LLP, PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP and KPMG LLP. After a thorough review process, the 
Committee agreed to recommend to the Board that Deloitte LLP 
be retained as the Company's external auditor, with which the 
Board concurred. Resolutions will put to shareholders at the AGM 
over the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP and the setting of its fees.
Non-audit services
The Committee reviews regularly the amount and nature of 
non-audit work performed by the external auditor. The Committee 
accepts in principle that certain work of a non-audit nature is best 
undertaken by the external auditor. The Company's policy on 
non-audit services provides clear guidance on the categories of 
non-audit work which may be undertaken by the external auditor, 
as well as setting out categories of work that may not be 
undertaken by the external auditor. The policy also sets out 
the circumstances when consent from the Committee is 
required where work falls into neither the pre-approved nor 
prohibited categories. 
Committee effectiveness
The Committee conducted a review of its effectiveness taking both 
direct feedback and also considering the findings of the Board review 
conducted by the Senior Independent Director. The review concluded 
that the Committee had received sufficient, reliable and timely 
information from management to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities 
and that the Committee had performed a valuable role in debating the 
Company's risk assessment and in holding management to account 
in relation to the effectiveness of the Company's control environment 
and associated assurance processes.
