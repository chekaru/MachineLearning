20 Corporate governance
This Report explains the Board's application of the Principles of Good Governance contained in Section 1 of the Revised 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance published in July 2003.
The Company introduced a number of new procedures to comply with the Revised Combined Code during the previous 
year. In this report the Board has adopted the  comply or explain' principle introduced by the Cadbury Report and  
reinforced by Higgs, and explains where the Group does not fully comply with the recommendations, giving reasons  
for such non-compliance.
The Board
The Board consists of four executive and five non executive Directors and the role of Chairman and Group Managing 
Director are clearly defined and separate. Mr Dean is the senior independent non executive Director.
In accordance with the Articles of Association one third of the Board is required to retire by rotation each year. In addition any 
Director appointed during the year will stand for re-election at the next Annual General Meeting. One of the non executive 
Directors, John Kelly, will be standing for re-election on an annual basis to comply with the Revised Combined Code as he 
has been a member of the Board for over nine years. The Board recommends shareholders to vote in favour of Mr Kelly's  
re-election as he continues to provide valuable experience and insight for the benefit of the Company, particularly from his 
own area of expertise. As a result of the formal evaluation procedure undertaken this year the Board is of the view Mr Kelly 
remains effective and committed to his role on the Board and its Committees. The Directors are of the view that Mr Kelly 
continues to be independent notwithstanding his service of more than nine years as he has no business or other relationship 
with the company or management which in any way affects his independence and he remains robustly independent of 
thought, expression and judgement. The Board also considers Mr Hobdey , Mr Dean and Mr Ross to be independent.
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the proper management of the Group and for the Group's system of corporate 
governance. It reviews trading performance forecasts and strategy and agrees future plans. The non executive Chairman, 
John Kelly, is responsible for the running of the Board. Executive responsibility for the running of the Company's business 
rests with the four executive directors, Bill Wood, Neil Carrick, Peter Nevitt and Winston Phillips. The Directors are provided 
with regular information on the Company's performance and activities and meet on a monthly basis. Meetings include a 
formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for the Board's decision and additional meetings are arranged as necessary. 
The Board met thirteen times during the year and all of the meetings were attended by all Directors, with the exception  
of James Dean who did not attend four meetings and Messrs Bolton, Kelly, Nevitt, Hobdey and Phillips who did not attend  
two meetings. Mr Ross who joined the Board on 12 April 2005 did not attend four meetings. The non executive Directors 
periodically visit different parts of the Group and meet the local management. Through this procedure the Board is able to 
retain full control of the Group, determining strategy and monitoring performance of objectives and compliance with policies. 
Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and may take independent professional advice  
if necessary, at the Company's expense. Appropriate training is available for all Directors as required. Executive and non 
executive Directors are formally appointed by the Board as a whole. Whilst non executive Directors are not appointed for  
a specific term, their re-election is, along with all other Directors, submitted to the shareholders in General Meeting on  
a rotational basis at least once every three years and at the first opportunity after their initial appointment. Non executive 
Directors do not benefit from share options or pension provisions.
Board evaluation
The Board conducted a formal evaluation of its own performance and that of its committees and individual Directors during 
the year. The evaluation consisted of questionnaires. All Directors, excluding the Chairman, took part in the evaluation of  
the Chairman.
All necessary actions will be implemented following the Board appraisal of the review findings. 
Board Committees
The Audit and Remuneration Committees of the Board are chaired by Mr Hobdey and Mr Dean respectively and are 
constituted by the five non executive Directors.
The Audit Committee has written terms of reference which are available from the Company Secretary on request. Its main 
responsibilities are to review the financial statements integrity and announcements relating to the Group's performance and 
review the scope and findings of the Group's external Auditors and the Group's accounting controls and procedures through 
regular monitoring and a programme of internal audit reviews of controls of operating units.

The Committee is also responsible for making recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment of the external 
auditor. During the financial year the Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the external audit process and the audit 
strategy proposed by KPMG Audit Plc.
The Committee has met with the external auditors to review their independence procedures and received a letter from 
KPMG Audit Plc confirming that, in their opinion, they remained independent. The Committee has also reviewed the 
expertise, resources and qualifications of the external auditor and approved the proposed audit fee for the 2005 audit.  
The Group also uses KPMG for non audit work, principally tax advice, but the Committee and Board do not feel this 
undermines the auditors' independence, and the cost benefits in terms of the auditors' knowledge of the Group's businesses 
is significant. This balance remains under ongoing review by the Audit Committee. The Committee has recommended to the 
Board that it propose to shareholders that KPMG Audit Plc continue as the Company's external auditor and a resolution  
to that effect is included in the notice of meeting for this year's Annual General Meeting. The Committee met prior to the 
Board Meeting at which the interim financial statements and the annual report and accounts were approved. The Committee 
considered reports from the external auditor, the internal audit function and the status of the Group's risk management and 
reporting processes in addition to the accounting policies and financial reporting issues and judgements.
The Committee is also charged with reviewing arrangements by which staff may, in confidence, raise concerns about 
possible issues or improprieties with regard to financial reporting and in this regard the head of the Internal Audit function 
reports directly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee.
The Committee met four times during the year and the meetings were attended by all of the members of the Committee 
except that Mr Dean was unable to attend one meeting. All members were provided with reports in advance on which they 
were able to ask questions before the meetings. 
The Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration of Parent Board Directors and Senior Executives and makes 
recommendations to the Main Board in connection with the Executive Share Option Schemes. The Remuneration Report  
is set out on pages 16 to 19.
Internal controls
The Board is responsible for the Group's system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. The system is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate risks and therefore can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material misstatement or loss.
The Group has formally implemented a process to identify, evaluate and manage the Group's significant risks. The principal 
elements of the internal control system which accord with the Turnbull guidance and were in force throughout the period 
covered by the financial statements and to the date of signing the accounts are described below.
The Board has put in place an organisational structure where operating and restricted financial responsibility is clearly 
delegated to the divisional management. This allows the Group to obtain maximum benefit from their skill in the relevant 
business sector. Identification and assessment of the risks inherent in each operating unit is carried out annually by means  
of a risk workshop incorporating a broad cross section of management. Management have identified appropriate risk 
management responses to the key risks generated by this exercise. Business risks are monitored at the monthly 
management meetings of the operating units which are usually attended by the Group Managing Director and Finance 
Director. The Board has reviewed a report summarising the risks for each operating unit and the Group as a whole.
The Group operates a comprehensive budgeting and financial reporting system. Annual budgets are approved by the  
Board and actual results are formally reviewed against budget and the prior year every month. Divisional management  
report monthly to the Board on their performance and any significant variances from budget and make revisions to  
forecasts as appropriate. Borrowings are controlled centrally and cash projections are prepared and monitored on a  
daily basis, if required, to ensure that the Group has adequate funds and resources for the foreseeable future.
Procedures and authorisation levels for all expenditure incurred throughout the Group have been defined. Capital expenditure 
in excess of  10,000 and all acquisitions are appraised and authorised by the Board.
There is a rolling programme of internal audit reviews of operating units which are documented and any significant findings or 
risks reported to the Audit Committee and appropriate action taken. The external auditors, in carrying out their work in order 
to express an opinion on the financial statements, review and test the systems of internal financial control and the information 
contained in the financial statements. They report on any weaknesses found when meeting with the Audit Committee.
