 6. Elementis plc Annual Report 2005
Operating and financial review continued
for pigments was depressed by a 
weaker US coatings market. Global 
supply-demand balances during the 
year were favourable, leading to higher 
sales prices, and were supported by 
plant closures in the Far East.

Elementis Chromium sales in 2005  
were  129.4 million, an improvement  
of 17 per cent over the previous year. 
This was largely driven by a programme 
of quarterly price increases, led by 
Elementis to restore profit margins, and 
resulted in a 21 per cent improvement 
in average prices versus the previous 
year. Prices improved in all major 
product sectors, but there were some 
related volume losses which resulted in 
an overall volume reduction of 4 per 
cent compared to 2004. Volumes were 
higher in North America, due to strong 
CCA demand, but lower in all other 
major geographic sectors. In Asia 
Pacific, there was a reduction in China, 
where pricing was less robust, but an 
increase in Japan where plant closures 
led to additional supply opportunities.
Operating profit before exceptional 
items in 2005 was  7.8 million 
compared to  0.4 million in 2004. 
Higher selling prices were the main 
driver of the overall improvement,  
and more than offset increases  
of  5.6 million in energy costs and  
 6.8 million in raw material costs.
The US business reported a profit  
of  8.1 million for the year  
(2004:  6.7 million) while the UK 
business, which is being restructured, 
reported a loss of  0.3 million  
(2004:  6.3 million). The UK business 
made a loss in the first half of the year 
but was profitable in the second half 
due to higher selling prices.
Elementis Pigments
In 2005 Elementis Pigments successfully 
completed the transitioning of its North 
American manufacturing base to a  
new plant in China. The majority of 
operations at the East St Louis plant 
closed on 30 June 2005 and most major 
customers have approved the new 
Chinese material.
Coatings markets served by Elementis 
Pigments showed the same overall 
trends as described under Elementis 
Specialty products. Good growth was 
seen in Asia but demand was relatively 
flat in the US and Europe. The US 
represents Elementis Pigments' largest 
market and while there was reasonable 
growth in the architectural sector, 
demand for industrial applications was 
lower than the previous year leading to 
an overall softer coatings market for the 
year. In the construction market 
demand was also lower, albeit from 
record levels in the previous year.
Sales in Elementis Pigments were  
 90.7 million (2004:  79.1 million).  
The transfer of the driers business  
from Elementis Specialties in early  
2005 contributed  13.4 million of the 
increase in sales. Otherwise prices 
improved by approximately 3 per cent 
due to increases being applied in all  
key market sectors to offset rising raw 
material and energy costs. Volumes 
were 6 per cent lower than 2004 due  
to the effects of the price increases as 
well as softer market demand.
Operating profit before exceptional 
items for the year was  1.2 million 
(2004:  1.8 million). Benefits from higher 
pricing and the inclusion of the Servo 
driers business were offset by lower

sales volumes and second half 
inefficiencies from the transfer of 
production to the China plant. 
Additional inventory was produced at 
the higher cost East St Louis plant to 
support key customers during the 
transition, and this effectively delayed 
the benefits of selling the lower cost 
Chinese product until 2006. In addition 
the US plant continued to run during 
July and August as part of the shut 
down process and this led to some 
duplication of manufacturing costs 
with the Chinese plant, which started 
up at the same time. Going forward,  
the transfer of production to the new 
plant is expected to reduce annualised 
manufacturing costs by around  
 3.0 million, once the East St Louis 
inventory is fully depleted. Consequently 
2006 is expected to benefit from around 
70 per cent of this saving.
Central costs
Central costs in 2005 were reduced  
by  1.8 million to  7.5 million  
(2004:  9.3 million). The reduction  
was the result of a reorganisation of 
head office in which functions were 
downsized or absorbed by business 
units. Annual employee related costs 
were reduced by around 80 per cent by 
the end of 2005 and the full effect of 
the reductions will be reflected in 2006.
Exceptional items
In the first half, exceptional charges of 
 6.3 million were announced. These 
comprised the closure of the majority 
of operations at the Pigments' East St 
Louis plant, the first phase of the Servo 
integration, a head office restructure 
and the disposal of the Hardman 
adhesives business. The first phase  
of a strategic review was announced  
on 31 October 2005, which resulted in 
exceptional charges of  32.9 million. 
These related to the closure of a kiln at 
Chromium, together with severance 
and other restructuring costs and 
related pension curtailment gains. 
Further exceptional items of  
 8.5 million have been incurred in the 
second half from the sale of Specialty 
Rubber, other curtailment gains on 
pension schemes and the settlement  
of legal and insurance claims. 
Total exceptional items before taxation 
in the year were  47.7 million  
(2004:  2.4 million) and are set out  
in note 5.
Interest
Net interest payable increased by  
 2.0 million to  7.6 million in 2005 
(2004:  5.6 million). This includes  
 0.1 million (2004:  0.2 million) in 
respect of discontinued operations. 
Interest payable on net borrowings 
increased by  2.6 million to  6.4 million 
(2004:  3.8 million) due to higher 
average borrowings and higher interest 
rates. The finance charge in respect of 
pension and post-retirement benefits 
decreased by  0.7 million in the year,  
to  0.4 million (2004:  1.1 million) due  
to the higher expected return on  
UK pension scheme assets and 
contributions paid into the UK scheme.
Interest cover - the ratio of operating 
profit before exceptional items to 
interest on net borrowings - was  
3.3 times (2004: 3.3 times). 
Taxation

Tax charge  million per cent 
Before exceptional items 0.3 2.6

The low rate of taxation on profit before 
exceptional items is due to the amortisation 
of goodwill in the US for tax purposes. 
Taxation on exceptional items of  
 3.1 million arose on pension scheme 
curtailment gains and due to the write 
off of  2.3 million in relation to deferred 
tax previously provided on UK pension 
schemes. Potential deferred tax assets 
of  31.6 million (2004:  28.8 million) in 
respect of carried forward losses have 
not yet been recognised. 8. Elementis plc Annual Report 2005

Operating and financial review continued
The effective tax rate on profit before 
exceptional items in 2006 will continue 
to be dependent on the mix of profits 
primarily between the UK and overseas, 
and the utilisation of tax losses in the 
UK and the US. 
Earnings per share
Earnings per share for the year was  
a loss of 8.8 pence per share  
(2004: earnings of 0.8 pence), due  
to  the exceptional charges in the  
year. Basic earnings per share before 
exceptional items increased to  
2.8 pence (2004: 1.3 pence) due to the 
increased operating profit partly offset 
by increased net interest costs.
Dividends and issue of redeemable 
B shares
The Board has decided not to continue 
with the programme of issuing and 
redeeming redeemable B shares, and is 
proposing a final dividend of 1.1 pence 
per share.
The total nominal value of redeemable 
B shares that were issued to shareholders 
during 2005 was 2.2 pence per  
ordinary share.
A final offer will be made to existing 
holders of redeemable B shares to 
redeem any remaining B shares in  
issue for cash at their nominal value  
in November 2006.

Net borrowings increased

of the US dollar against sterling 
increased reported borrowings  
by  8.8 million. Ebitda  increased  
by  11.5 million to  38.5 million  
(2004:  27.0 million) due to the 
improved operating performance.
