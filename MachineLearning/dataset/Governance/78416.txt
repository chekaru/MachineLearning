EMPLOYEES
Fulcrum involves all its employees in its corporate objectives,
plans, and performance and on other relevant matters of interest
to employees through various communication methods and
regular Company meetings. The Company is an equal opportunity
employer and does not discriminate in the recruitment and
promotion of staff. All employees are included in the Company's
bonus incentive plan and also, if qualified, are entitled to receive
share options within the Company's share option scheme.
CREDITOR PAYMENT POLICY
The Company's policy is to pay suppliers within the terms of the
invoice. This policy and any specific terms agreed with suppliers
are made known to the appropriate staff and to suppliers on
request.
SUBSTANTIAL SHAREHOLDINGS
The Company had the following shareholdings amounting to 3%
or more of the ordinary share capital of the Company as at 31
August 2002.
The substantial shareholdings were unchanged as at 
12 November 2002.
SAFETY, HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT
Fulcrum is committed to maintaining high standards of safety,
health and environmental protection by conducting itself in a
responsible manner to protect people and the environment. In
pursuit of this, the Company has established Health and Safety
procedures and policies under the control of a responsible
manager. Consultants have been appointed to help monitor and
train the staff of the Company.
TREASURY POLICY
The Company's treasury policy is one of conservatism approved
by the Board. Cash balances are managed as described in note
19. As a matter of policy, Fulcrum does not undertake speculative
transactions, which would increase its currency or interest rate
exposure.
AUDITORS
PricewaterhouseCoopers were appointed auditors to the
Company during the year to fill a casual vacancy. Their
appointment will be ratified at the Annual General Meeting, at
which time a resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers as
auditors will also be proposed.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT
The Company's shares are traded on the Alternative Investment
Market (AIM ) of the London Stock Exchange. The Group is
therefore subject to the AIM Admission Rules of the London
Stock Exchange and is consequently not required to comply with
the best practice corporate governance provisions contained
within the Combined Code appended to the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority. 
THE BOARD
The Board currently comprises the executive and non-executive
directors. Given the current small size of the Company, it is not
felt appropriate to appoint more than two non-executive
directors, namely Professor Sir Charles George and Dr David
Clough. A minimum of six board meetings is held annually. The
Board is responsible for overall strategy, major finance matters
and internal financial control. It also monitors executive
management in the business through its review of financial,
strategic and operational matters. All directors are subject to
retirement by rotation. 
BOARD COMMITTEES
The Board has established both Audit and Compensation
Committees, each with defined terms of reference.

Dr G E Walters 6,976,328 5.72% 2,133,333 3.47% An Audit Committee has been established which consists of the
non-executive directors and Neil Oughton. It meets at least twice
each year and is responsible for ensuring that the financial
performance of the Group is properly reported on and monitored,
for meeting the auditors and reviewing the reports from the
auditors relating to the financial statements and internal financial
control systems.
A Compensation Committee has been established, which consists
of the non-executive directors and Alastair Devlin. It meets at
least twice each year and reviews the performance of executive
directors and sets the scale and structure of their remuneration
having due regard to the interests of the shareholders. The
Committee also administers the share option scheme.
INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROL
The directors are responsible for ensuring that the Group
maintains a system of internal financial control to provide them
with reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
information used within the business and for publication, and
that the assets are safeguarded. There are inherent limitations in
any system of internal financial control and, accordingly, even the
most effective system can provide only reasonable, but not
absolute, assurance with respect to the preparation of financial
information and the safeguarding of assets.
The Group, in administering its business, has put in place strict
authorisation, approval and control levels within which senior
management operates. These controls reflect the Group's
organisational structure and business objectives. This control
system includes clear lines of accountability to cover all areas of
the organisation. The Board operates procedures which include
an appropriate control environment through the definition of the
above organisation structure and authority levels, the
identification of the major business risks facing the Group, the
development of appropriate procedures and controls to manage
those risks, and a budgeting and reporting system with results
compared with budget and variance analysis and re-forecasting
of projected results. 
GOING CONCERN
The directors have reviewed the Group's budgets and forecasts
with respect to its financial position as at 31 August 2002. After
taking into consideration the cash flow implications of these
plans, the directors are satisfied that it is appropriate to produce
the Group accounts on a going concern basis. 
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year that give a true and fair view
of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the
profit or loss of the Group for that year. The directors are
required to prepare the financial statements on the going concern
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and
the Group will continue in business.
The directors confirm that suitable accounting policies have been
used and applied consistently, with the exception of the changes
arising on the adoption of new accounting standards in the year
as explained in Note 1. They also confirm that reasonable and
prudent judgements and estimates have been made in preparing
the financial statements for the year ended 31 August 2002 and
that applicable accounting standards have been followed.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them
to ensure that the financial statements comply with the
Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding
the assets of the Company and of the Group and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and
other irregularities.
The maintenance and integrity of the Fulcrum Pharma plc
website is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out
by the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters
and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any
changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since
they were initially presented on the website. Legislation in the
United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of
financial statements may differ from legislation in other
jurisdictions.
