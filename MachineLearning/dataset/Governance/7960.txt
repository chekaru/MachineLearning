Corporate Governance Statement 
 
 13 
The Directors recognise the importance of sound corporate governance, whilst taking into account the size and nature 
of the Group.  
The Board 
The Board is responsible to the shareholders for the proper management of the Group. The Board is responsible for 
setting the Group's strategic direction, the establishment of Group policies and internal controls and the monitoring 
of operational performance. It meets regularly throughout the year and, in addition to the routine reporting of 
financial and operational issues, reviews certain key functions such as fuel and currency hedging between meetings. 
The Board has a schedule of matters specifically reserved to it for decision. The Board meeting agenda normally 
comprises inter alia strategy, an operational review and a financial review. Specific meetings cover the approval of 
the interim and preliminary financial results and the approval of the annual budget. Information is normally provided 
to all Board members in the week prior to a Board meeting to enable the Directors to consider the issues for 
discussion and to request clarification or additional information. The Board regularly reviews the type and amount of 
information provided. The Board plans to meet at least 6 times a year and in FY08/09 met a total of 12 times. All 
Directors have access to the advice of the Company Secretary Peter Buckley, who is responsible to the Board for 
ensuring that procedures are followed. A statement of Directors' responsibilities in respect of the financial statements 
is set out in this Annual Report on page 22.  
 
At 31 October 2009, the Board comprised of four executive directors and two non-executive directors. The Board 
consisted of the Executive Chairman, three further Executive Directors and two Non-Executive Directors which in 
the opinion of the Board is an appropriate composition for the Group at this stage of its development. The positions 
of Chairman and Group Chief Executive are not combined, ensuring a clear division of responsibility at the head of 
the Group. The board brings a range of experience and expertise sufficient to bring independent judgement on issues 
of strategy, performance, safety, resources and standards of conduct which is vital to the success of the Group. At the 
Annual General Meeting held on 14 April 2009, Philip Ovenden and Guy Marchant put themselves forward for re-
election to office and were duly reappointed.  
 
Both non-executive directors hold shares in the Group, as disclosed in the Directors' Report. However because the 
number of shares held is relatively small and there are no cross directorships between executive and non-executive 
directors, these shareholdings are not believed to impact on Non-Executive Directors' independence. Nigel Jenkins is 
considered an independent director by the Group. Philip Ovenden, is not deemed independent due to previous 
executive employment arrangements with the Group which ended in October 2007.  
 
The Executive Chairman of the Board is Roger Allard who is responsible for the preparation and execution of the 
Group's strategic plan. Rob Bryant is the Chief Executive Officer and is responsible for co-ordination of the Group's 
business activities. Guy Marchant as Group Finance Director is responsible for the production of both management 
and statutory accounts. Ross Jobber was appointed Chief Operating Officer in January 2009 with responsibilities for 
group HR, IT and compliance as well as supporting the Chairman and Chief Executive in corporate development.  All Leisure group plc

The Board (continued) 
 
At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, Rob Bryant and Ross Jobber are offering themselves for re-election. 
Subject to re-election at the first AGM after which they are appointed, all Non-Executive Directors are appointed 
initially for a three year term and, after review, may be proposed for a further three year term. The Group will take 
into account the balance of skills and experience on the Board, and their contribution and level of independence 
when considering whether to extend their appointment beyond the initial term. 
 
Following the acquisition of Blue Oar Securities Limited by Evolve Capital plc on 29 December 2008 the Board took 
the decision to review its Nominated Advisor (NOMAD ) arrangements. Following an extensive review process, 
the Group appointed Panmure Gordon (UK) Limited as its new NOMAD on 26 June 2009. The Board takes 
significant measures to ensure that all Board members are kept aware of both the views of major shareholders and 
changes in the major shareholdings of the Group. This is achieved by giving all Directors access to the Group's 
NOMAD. 
Board Committees 
In accordance with corporate governance best practice, the Board has established Audit and Remuneration 
committees, comprising two non-executive directors for both the audit and remuneration committees. 
The committees have duties and responsibilities formally delegated to them by the Board.  The committees have the 
following memberships: 
 
Remuneration Committee (2008/9):  Nigel Jenkins (Chair), Philip Ovenden 
Remuneration Committee (2009/10) Nigel Jenkins (Chair), Philip Ovenden 
 
Audit Committee (2008/9):   Ross Jobber / Philip Ovenden (Chair), Nigel Jenkins 
Audit Committee (2009/10):  Philip Ovenden (Chair), Nigel Jenkins

Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee was chaired from 1
st
 November 2008 to 12
th
 January 2009 by Ross Jobber and thereafter (and 
currently) by Philip Ovenden. It comprises both an independent and a non-independent non-executive director. The 
Chairman, Chief Executive and Finance Director are invited to attend meetings, as appropriate. The Audit 
Committee reviews the half-year and annual financial statements, matters related to internal controls and holds the 
relationship with the external audit function. In addition, the Audit Committee ensures that an objective and 
professional relationship is maintained with the external auditors, with particular regard to the nature and extent of 
any non-audit functions they provide. During the year ended 31 October 2009, the Group's external auditors, 
Deloitte LLP (Deloitte ), provided non audit services to the Group. The fees paid to Deloitte for non audit services 
were  30,000 (2008:  20,000) excluding VAT. The use of Deloitte for non-audit work was carefully evaluated by the 
Audit Committee, which was satisfied that the necessary independence was achieved by virtue of the fact that the 
accounts in question were prepared and audited prior to Deloitte being appointed the Group's auditor. The Audit 
Committee views the independence and objectivity of the Group's auditors as essential and ensures that Deloitte are 
not instructed on any issue which would prejudice this. The Audit Committee obtains written confirmation on at least 
an annual basis of the independence of the external auditors. The Audit Committee also reviews the possible risks 
facing the Group, the risk management function and internal controls. In particular it is constantly updated on 
decisions made by executive directors regarding currency and fuel hedging. 
 
The Group places the utmost importance on the timely dissemination of operational and financial reports. The Group 
Financial Controller, Mark Jeffries reports to the Group Finance Director and is responsible for the preparation of the 
Group's management accounts.  
 
In the year ended 31 October 2009 the Audit Committee met with the Group auditors, Deloitte, without the Chairman 
or Chief Executive present. The chairman of the Audit Committee also met with the Group auditors in the presence 
of the Chairman and Chief Executive on several occasions. 
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee has the primary responsibility to review the performance of the Company's executive 
directors and Company Secretary and to set their remuneration and other terms of employment. The Remuneration 
Committee is chaired by Nigel Jenkins and consists of both Non- Executive Directors.  
Nominations Committee 
Given the size of the Company the board deems it appropriate that all members are closely involved in nominating 
new board members and therefore no Nominations Committee exists at this time. The board will review this 
arrangement annually. 
Going concern 
After making enquiries, the Directors have formed a judgement at the time of approving these financial statements 
that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. For this reason, the Directors have adopted the going concern basis in preparing these 
financial statements.  Further details are provided in the Finance Director's Report. 
Relations with shareholders 
Results are released on a semi-annual basis as required under the AIM Rules. Existing and potential institutional 
investors are offered one-on-one meetings with Executive Directors immediately thereafter. The primary 
responsibility for this process lies with the Executive Chairman, supported by the Chief Operating Officer. All 
shareholders have the opportunity to put questions to the Board at the Annual General Meeting and at other times by 
emailing or writing to the Company or to its NOMAD Panmure Gordon (UK) Limited. Citigate Dewe Rogerson 
advises the Group on the optimal dissemination of relevant information to shareholders and to the market in general. 
In addition, the Group maintains a website pursuant to Rule 26 of the AIM Rules for Companies containing 
constitutional documents, press releases and Company contact information.
