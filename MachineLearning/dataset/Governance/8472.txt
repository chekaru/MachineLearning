The audit committee consists of five
independent non-executive Directors,
Neil Cross (Committee Chairman),
Adrian Loader, Paolo Scaroni, Patrick
Ponsolle and Manfred Stach. The Group
Finance Director, the Director of
Internal Audit, the Group Financial
Controller and representatives from the

committee met four times during 2004,
the attendance record of members
being shown in the table on page 41.
Manfred Stach, who was appointed to
the Committee at the end of 2003, was
unable to attend meetings during 2004
due to commitments agreed prior to
his appointment. He received all
meeting papers and information and
was able to discuss issues arising with
the Committee Chairman. He waived
his audit committee fee for the period
under review.
The Director of Internal Audit has the
right of direct access to the committee
and the Chairman of the Company. The
committee has the right to seek and
receive any information it requires to
fulfil its duties and all Directors and
employees are directed to co-operate
with any request made by the
committee and to attend on demand
any meeting of the committee to
answer questions.
At each meeting in 2004, the
committee met the Director of Internal
Audit and representatives from the
external auditors without executive
management present. Attendance of
members at committee meetings is
shown in the Board report on
corporate governance. The Chairman of
the committee attends the AGM to
respond to any shareholder questions
that might be raised on the
committee's activities. 
Neil Cross has a background in
investment analysis and corporate
finance, is a Chartered Secretary and
chairs four PLC Audit Committees. The
Board is satisfied, in line with the Code,
that he has both current and relevant
financial experience.

Audit committee report 43 Alliance UniChem Plc
 a review of the committee's
effectiveness which concluded that it
had discharged its responsibilities as
set out in its terms of reference;
  a review of internal controls,
accounting policies and practices and
risk management procedures. The
committee monitored and reviewed
the effectiveness of the Group's
internal control systems, accounting
policies and practices and risk
management procedures, as well as
the Company's statement on internal
controls. The Board retains overall
responsibility for internal control and
the identification and management
of risks; and
  the transition to International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
The committee was updated during
the year on the IFRS implementation
project undertaken by management
and reviewed the preparatory work
carried out by the external auditors
on the 2004 opening balance sheet.
The first external report to be
prepared under IFRS will be the
Interim Report 2005.
Policy on non-audit services
As part of its remit, the committee
keeps under review the nature and
extent of audit and non-audit services
provided to the Group by the external
auditors. The committee has approved
a policy for the approval of non-audit
services provided by external auditors.
Under this policy, external auditors
cannot be engaged to perform any of
the following services:
  bookkeeping for underlying
accounting records or preparation of
financial statements to be audited
and used outside the Group;
  appraisals or other valuation services
where the results may be
incorporated in audited financial
statements;
  actuarial services;
  management functions including
human resources;
  investment advisory services including
broking or investment banking;
  legal services;
  internal audit (on an outsourced
basis);
  design and/or implementation of
financial information systems; and
  any other services that a listed
company's external auditors are
prohibited from providing under UK
or US regulations. 
This list of prohibited non-audit services
may only be varied by the audit
committee.
Under this policy it has been agreed
that, due to their significant
understanding of the Group's business
and therefore ensuring cost efficiency,
the external auditors may be engaged
for the following non-audit services:
  assistance in tax compliance activities
including tax advisory services;
  due diligence activities associated
with potential acquisitions or
disposals of businesses;
  accountants reports for any Stock
Exchange purposes and ad hoc
reporting on historical financial
information; and
  any other services which are not
prohibited and are authorised by the
audit committee.
The policy requires the fees for these
permitted non-audit services to be
approved in advance by the committee.
Where such services are considered to
be recurring in nature, such as for tax
and due diligence, approval may be
sought for the full financial year at the
beginning of that year. Approval for
other permitted non-audit services has
to be sought on an ad hoc basis. Where
no committee meeting is scheduled
within an appropriate time frame, the
approval is to be sought from the
Chairman of the committee. The fee
threshold for pre-approved services at
31 December 2004 was  0.6 million
(b0.9 million) per annum for taxation
services and  0.5 million (b0.8 million)
per annum for due diligence and
related services.
Whistleblowing 
During 2004 the committee reviewed
arrangements for employees to raise
concerns, in confidence, about possible
wrongdoing in financial reporting or
other matters in accordance with the
requirements of the Code. In the UK a
24 hour helpline, managed by a third
party, was introduced. This helpline
provides reports to designated officers
of the Company, including the
Company Secretary, who in turn report
cases to the committee. Throughout
the rest of the Group, the Company's
whistleblowing policy sets out
arrangements whereby employees can
report to the Company Secretary any
concerns or suspicions about possible
wrongdoing in financial reporting or
other matters, which are reported to
the committee.
