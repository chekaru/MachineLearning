directors' reMUNerA tioN report
The Directors present the Directors' Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2008. A resolution to approve the Report 
will be proposed at the Company's AGM. The auditors are required to report to the shareholders on the audited section of the Report 
and to state whether in their opinion it has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. The Report therefore has 
separate sections containing unaudited and audited information.

remuneration committee The remuneration of the Executive Directors is fixed by the Remuneration Committee which during the year comprised the three 
Non-executive Directors, namely M I Gunston (Chairman), J E Brown and J S Reis, with the Managing Director, E J Boot, in attendance. 
The Executive Directors, E J Boot, J T Sutcliffe and D Greaves, determine the remuneration of the Non-executive Directors.
T o assist the Directors in determining the appropriate policy and levels of remuneration, reference is made, in addition to comparisons 
of policies with peer companies, to external publications, including the Income Data Services Limited Executive Compensation Review. 
remuneration policy
The Company's policy on Directors' remuneration is to ensure that the Directors are competitively rewarded on a basis that is 
comparable with similar companies, taking into account the need to attract, motivate and retain Directors of an appropriate calibre to 
achieve the Company's objectives, without making excessive payments. Directors' basic salaries and benefits are reviewed annually 
taking into account individual performance, the recommendations of the Group Managing Director and published remuneration 
information. Benefits include the provision of a Company car or a cash allowance alternative, permanent health insurance and private 
medical insurance. The value of benefits is not pensionable and is set out for each Director in the Directors' remuneration table. 
Non-executive Directors are remunerated on the basis of their anticipated time commitment and the responsibilities entailed in their 
role. There are no service agreements in place for the Non-executive Directors and they do not participate in any of the Company's 
incentive arrangements. Newly appointed Non-executive Directors are expected to serve at least an initial period of three years. 
T erms and conditions relating to Non-executive Directors are available for inspection.
E J Boot and D Greaves each have a one year rolling service agreement. J T Sutcliffe does not have a service agreement. His terms 
and conditions of employment are set out in his contract of employment and include a one year notice period. T ermination of these 
agreements would therefore be subject to their contractual terms and conditions.
The Executive Directors participate in an annual bonus scheme. This is calculated by reference to pre-tax profits achieved in the year, 
compared with budget, and as recommended by the Remuneration Committee. The annual bonus payable to E J Boot is partly 
pensionable, but for all other Executive Directors the bonus is not pensionable. 
The Executive Directors participate in the Henry Boot PLC 2000 Sharesave Scheme. The scheme was approved by shareholders 
and is subject to HMRC rules. A grant of options was made on 1 November 2006 at an exercise price of 155.4p, a 15% discount 
to the prevailing market price. A further grant of options was made on 22 October 2008 at an exercise price of 77p, a 10% discount 
to the prevailing market price. There are no performance criteria attached to the exercise of these options which are capable of 
exercise for a six month period three years from the date of grant.
The Executive Directors have participated in the 1996 Henry Boot PLC Long-T erm Incentive Plan, which was introduced in 1996 and which 
was subsequently replaced by the Henry Boot 2006 Long-T erm Incentive Plan in 2006. The principle of a long-term incentive scheme for 
senior executives is one that the Remuneration Committee and the Company believes readily aligns the interests of Executive Directors 
and shareholders, whilst providing the motivation and incentive for the Directors to perform at the highest levels. Under the provisions of the 
Henry Boot 2006 Long-T erm Incentive Plan, approved by shareholders at an EGM on 20 July 2006, participants may receive a provisional 
allocation of shares up to 120% of basic salary calculated by reference to the share price at that time. This limit can only be exceeded in 
exceptional circumstances at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. Those allocated to J T Sutcliffe in 2008 were made on this 
latter basis. Awards under the Plan, which usually vest in three years, are subject to three performance conditions over that three year 
period. These are the per annum increase in net asset value per share compared to the Investment Property Databank UK Annual Index, 
the increase in profitability compared to the Retail Prices Index and T otal Shareholder Return (TSR) compared to the median of a comparator 
group of the FTSE Small Cap Index. These targets ensure that the actual awards at the vesting date are aligned closely with the factors 
that drive shareholder return. 
E J Boot is a member of the Henry Boot Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme, a defined benefit pension scheme. J T Sutcliffe is 
a member of the Henry Boot Group Stakeholder Pension Scheme, a defined contribution scheme. D Greaves is beyond retirement age. 
Both schemes also provide a lump sum death in service benefit and a pension for dependents of members on their death in service 
and, on death after retirement, a pension for dependents. Normal retirement age is 65.

The transfer value has been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance Note GN11.
noteS
1.  Mr E J Boot's transfer values as at 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2008 are based on a currently capped final pensionable salary 
of  331,002. This is a change from previous years and so the transfer value as at 1 January 2008 has been restated compared to 
last year's disclosures.
2. The transfer values include changes due to revaluation in deferment.
3.  The increase in accrued benefit during the year is net of any increase for revaluation in deferment and the transfer value thereof 
calculated in accordance with the Trustees  chosen transfer value basis less an estimate of the Director s contributions for the year.
4.  The accumulated benefit accrued at 31 December 2008 represents the pension entitlement which would be preserved in the 
Scheme if the member had left service on 31 December 2008.
5. Benefits and contributions relating to any members' Additional Voluntary Contributions are not included in the above table.
defined contribution Scheme J T Sutcliffe is a member of the defined contribution scheme. Contributions paid by the Company in the year were  39,000.
