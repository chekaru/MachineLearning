We have audited the group financial statements of Huntsworth plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 which comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expense, the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and the related notes 1 to 29.  
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to  
state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or  
for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors' Responsibilities Statement set out on page 27, the directors are responsible for the 
preparation of the Consolidated financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility 
is to audit and express an opinion on the Consolidated financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board's Ethical Standards 
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes 
an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group's circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the group financial statements:
  Give a true and fair view of the state of the group's affairs as at 31 December 2011 and of its profit for the year then ended;
  Have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and 
  Have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Opinions on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors' Report for the financial year for which the consolidated financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
  Certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or
  We have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:
  The directors' statement, set out on page 18, in relation to going concern; 
  The part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company's compliance with the nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code specified for our review; and
  Certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on directors' remuneration.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Parent Company financial statements of Huntsworth plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 
and on the information in the Directors' Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
