Included in the Group's trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying value of  1,746,000 (2012 -  1,304,000) which are past due 
at the balance sheet date. the directors have reviewed the recoverability of these debtors and are satisfied, due to client relations and 
past payment experience, that the debtors are fully recoverable.the ageing of these debtors is as follows:

61 - 120 days 288 201

total 1,746 1,304 
In addition, trade receivable balances totalling  120,000 (2012 -  244,000), which are over 120 days past their due date have been provided
for. this amount relates to the sale of one item in 2010 which was fully provided against in 2011. the Directors remain concerned about the
recoverability of the remaining outstanding balance and so continue to provide against the whole of the remaining balance.
other receivables of  398,000 (2012 -  430,000) have been included in non-current assets as they related to amounts that are not due to
be received within the coming year.
Amounts due from subsidiary undertakings totalling  7,725,000 (2012 -  8,411,000) have been provided for. this is due to the
unpredictability of future profits in the trading companies arising from the uncertain nature of the antique furniture and decorative arts
market and the timing of their recovery.

the directors assessed the carrying value of each of the Group's non-current assets at the balance sheet date by estimating the
recoverable amount of each asset in accordance with the accounting policy in note 2. Based on market value assessments and a value in
use assessment, using a discount rate of 9.5%, the directors have impaired the investment in Mallett & Son (Antiques) limited by
 2,200,000 at the year end due the unpredictability of future profits arising from the uncertain nature of the antique furniture and
decorative arts market and the timing of its recovery. the directors believe the values shown of the non-current assets are recoverable.
During the year the Group purchased the remaining 50% shareholding of Ely House Gallery limited from James Harvey for a consideration
of  80,000. 
Gurr Johns limited own 40% of H.J. Hatfield & Sons limited.

Financial risk management objectives
Management monitor and manage the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group through regular reports to the Board. these
risks include liquidity risk, credit risk and currency risk. the Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments.
Credit risk
the Group's credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables. Credit risk is managed by monitoring the aggregate amount and
duration of exposure to any one customer. the Group's management estimate the level of allowances required for doubtful debts based on
prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Liquidity risk
the Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual
cash flows and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
At 31 December 2013, all the Group's liabilities had contractual maturities of less than six months (2012 - less than six months) and the
Group had undrawn borrowing facilities available of  311,000 (2012 -  1,043,000). the Group also maintains foreign currency denominated
bank accounts that earn interest based on Coutts & Co. base rate applicable to that currency.
Interest rate risk
the Group finances its operations where necessary through bank overdrafts.
If interest rates had been 1.0% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the impact on the results in the Income Statement
and equity would be an increase/decrease of  12,000 (2012 -  4,000).
Foreign currency risk
the Group receives payment for its products and incurs costs and inventory purchases in Pounds Sterling, uS Dollars and Euros. After
netting o  foreign currency receipts and payments there is a net exposure to the risk of currency movements in both uS Dollars and Euros.
the carrying amounts of the Group's foreign currency denominated monetary financial liabilities at the reporting date are as follows:
Functional currency of individual entity

uS Dollar 817 36 - - - 67 817 103 
818 38 37 61 - 67 855 166 
Foreign currency sensitivity
the Group is principally exposed to the uS Dollar and Euro currency movements.
the following table details the Group's sensitivity to a 5% decrease in Pound Sterling against the relevant foreign currencies:

the use of a 5% weakening in exchange rates is considered appropriate given recent movements in exchange rates.
the above analysis represents the Group's exposure to foreign currency risk based financial assets and liabilities outstanding at the year
end. A significant amount of the Group's sales and purchases are made in foreign currencies. the exposure to foreign exchange rates varies
throughout the year depending on the volume and timing of transactions in foreign currencies.

the bank overdraft is repayable on demand. the overdraft facility at the balance sheet date was  2,500,000. the facility is secured with a
fixed and floating charge on the Group's uK assets. the average e ective interest rate on the bank overdraft approximated to 2.13% (2012 -
2.13%), which is determined based on 2.0% above the Coutts & Co. base rate. the Group is currently undertaking a review of it's overdraft
facility requirements with it bankers, Coutts & Co, and the directors are confident that the Company will have adequate facilities in place to
cover the Group's cashflow requirements for the foreseeable future.
2012 Accruals and deferred income has been restated to reflect the smoothing of the lease rental payments on two leases for the Group's
New York premises over the life of the leases. this has led to an accrual being created of  746,000 in 2012 reflecting the number of years
passed on the leases. the accrual will be released to the profit and loss account over the remaining periods of the leases.
