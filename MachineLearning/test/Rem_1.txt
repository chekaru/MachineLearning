 Report of the Board on Directors' remuneration
Information not subject to audit
Remuneration committee and advisers
The remuneration committee, comprising three non-executive Directors, Barrie Clark, Steven Fink and Peter Magowan, appointed by the
Board, recommends, within agreed terms of reference, an overall remuneration package for executive Directors. The remuneration committee
has appointed Towers Perrin, a leading firm of executive remuneration consultants, to assess comparability to the market place.
Remuneration policy
The Company's policy on Directors' remuneration is that the overall remuneration package should be sufficiently competitive to attract, retain
and motivate high quality executives capable of achieving the Group's objectives and thereby enhancing shareholder value.
The package consists of basic salary, benefits, share options, performance related bonuses and pension contributions, with a significant
proportion based on performance and dependent upon the achievement of demanding targets.
A summary of each element of the remuneration package is set out below:
Basic salary and benefits
Basic salary and fees are determined after taking account of each Director's responsibilities and seniority, and of market salary levels for similar
jobs in comparable companies based on independent surveys. The committee also takes independent specialist advice from Towers Perrin in
relation to salaries, bonuses and longer term incentives. Basic salaries are reviewed annually taking account of both Group and individual
performance. Salary increases reflect changes in the market level and average increases for executives within the Group.
Benefits (normally car, pension and life, disability and health insurance) are set at a level comparable with those granted to executives at a
similar level in like companies.
The fees for non-executive Directors are determined by the Board and are reviewed periodically. By agreement, only two of the four non-
executive nominees of ET Training LLC receive fees in respect of these directorships.
Bonuses
Directors' bonuses are based on Group and individual performance and are discretionary. They are structured to enable the executives to
increase their basic earnings by up to 75% on the achievement of predetermined performance related targets set for the development of the
Group. The committee believes that exceptional performance deserves appropriate reward.
Share options
The Company has a number of approved and unapproved executive share option schemes, the details of which are provided on page 16 and
notes 19 and 20 to the accounts.
Annual grants under the schemes are subject to limits linked to relevant emoluments and contractual obligations, with a cap of  30,000
market-value on options granted under approved schemes. Unapproved option grants are discretionary and require the approval of the
remuneration committee. Except under certain limited circumstances, options cannot be exercised for a period of between three to five years
from the date of the grant, and are only exercisable where demonstrable enhancement in shareholder value has been achieved through
increases in the Spring share price. Performance criteria are detailed on page 16 and notes 19 and 20 to the accounts. The remuneration
committee assesses the performance criteria periodically, taking into account market conditions and Group performance.
Directors are eligible to join the savings related share option schemes on the same terms as other employees. Options under savings related
share option schemes are granted at a discount of 20% to the market price of shares at the date of invitation, in line with all other employees.

Terms of appointment and service contracts
The details below reflect the Company's general policy in respect of service contracts for Directors.
Non-executive Directors
Two of the non-executive Directors, B A Clark and P A Magowan, have fixed term consultancy agreements which expired on 28 August 2000
and are accordingly now being treated by the Company and the Directors as if they were on rolling notice contracts. These contracts can be
terminated by 12 months notice by the Company and 3 months notice by the non-executive.
The other non-executive Directors, being Knowledge Universe nominees, have no service contracts and are not entitled to a defined notice
period. Two of these non-executive Directors, J W Harch and P B Simon have been appointed since the last Annual General Meeting and will
therefore be seeking re-election at the next Annual General Meeting. In addition B A Clark retires by rotation and is seeking re-election at the
Annual General Meeting to be held on 12 May 2004. 
Executive Directors
R T Barfield and W J Grubbs have service contracts which allow for 12 months notice from the Company and the executive.
On termination of these agreements, except for reasons meriting summary dismissal, the Directors are entitled to a payment equivalent to
their salary and benefits for the unexpired term less tax and national insurance.
