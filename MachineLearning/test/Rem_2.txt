Remuneration policy
Historic
The Company's remuneration policy has been heavily influenced by both the Group's and the industry's history - in particular the 
exit from the market in the United States. As a result, the central principle of the Group's historic remuneration policy has been 
retention, in order to deliver stability during the Group's post-US turnaround  period. That period culminated in the settlement 
between the Company and the US Department of Justice, with the turnaround  successfully achieved.
Policy review
The Company's strategy is to continue to operate in both licence-issuing markets and markets which are yet to issue online licences 
within a regulated, non-discriminatory framework (non-licence issuing markets ). This means that the Group continues to face 
regulatory and operational risks, in the non-licence issuing markets served by the Group's European and Emerging Markets 
Divisions. The Company has increased the proportion of its overall business generated from licence-issuing, competitive markets  
and plans to continue this approach in the future. As a result, the risks facing the Group today are not on the same scale as in 2007 
(immediately post-US exit) or 2005 (the point at which the Group had reached a pinnacle in terms of its growth and success prior  
to the US legislative changes which led to the Group's enforced withdrawal from the US market).
Following a review undertaken by the Company's external remuneration consultants, MM&K, the Committee has agreed upon a 
policy shift from retention  to value creation  - essentially, shareholders and Directors share in the added valued generated from 
the successful implementation of the Company's strategy.
As recommended by the consultants, the Group's policy will be:
a) to continue to pay at or about market upper quartile levels in order to attract and retain key management talent and to reflect 
the risks associated with operating a global online betting and gaming business in both licence-issuing, competitive markets and 
non-licence issuing markets;
b) to ensure all incentive remuneration (short-term and long-term) is wholly performance related and linked to demanding 
performance criteria; and
c) to allow remuneration arrangements which pre-dated the Company's move to the Official List in 2010 and which may not have 
been compliant with the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (as was then in force) to be honoured up to 31 July 2012. 
This date coincides with the expiration of the Restricted Share Plan 2009.

Information subject to audit Sportingbet Plc Annual Report 201 1 41
GOVERNANCE
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Peter Dicks and its 
other members are Brian Harris, Sean O'Connor and Nigel 
Payne. Both Sean O'Connor and Nigel Payne will resign on 16 
December 2011. The Company recognises that having the 
Chairman of the Company as Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee does not comply with the provision of D.2.1 of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code (Code ) and that this 
provision also requires the Committee to be made up of three 
independent Non-Executive Directors. From 16 December 2011, 
Sean O'Connor will be replaced by Rory Macnamara and Nigel 
Payne will be replaced by Chris Moss both of whom are 
independent for the purposes of the Code. The Board intends 
to revisit the composition of the Remuneration Committee in 
order to comply with the Code and intends to do so following 
the release of the Company's financial year results on 5 October 
2011. In line with the policy shift to value creation , the 
Remuneration Committee seeks to structure total benefits 
packages, including base salaries, which align the interests  
of shareholders and senior management with particular 
importance weighted upon the performance-related elements 
of such total remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee aims to seek and retain the 
appropriate calibre of people and recommends fee levels to the 
Board consistent with prevailing market conditions, peer group 
companies and Directors' roles and responsibilities.
Specifically, when considering adoption of the Sportingbet 
Restricted Share Plan 2009, the Remuneration Committee 
assessed the needs of the Company for the period through to 
2012 compared to the Company's needs when the Sportingbet 
2006 Restricted Share Plan was introduced in November 2006 
immediately following the enactment of the Unlawful Internet 
Gambling Enforcement Act 2006.
Directors' remuneration will continue to be the subject of 
regular review in accordance with the new remuneration policy 
in the next financial year. 
Terms of reference
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee include:
 	 To determine the remuneration and benefits, including 
incentive arrangements, of the Executive Directors, the 
directors of divisional companies and other employees of 
similar status.
 	 To set targets for performance-related pay elements of 
remuneration packages.
 	 To review recommendations from the Board on the overall 
remuneration and benefits policy of the Group, with the 
power and authority to amend it if appropriate.
 	 To have regard to the provisions of the Combined Code and 
associated guidance in its decision-making.
The Directors intend that the Company's remuneration policy 
will be set by the Remuneration Committee in accordance with 
the terms of reference set out above for the following financial 
year and subsequent financial years.
Salary review - CEO and CFO
Following an external benchmarking exercise to assess the 
salaries of both Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial 
Officers across the Company's peer group
1
, Jim Wilkinson was 
awarded a salary increase of 6% to  315,000 on 1 August 
2010. As has been the case since Andrew McIver became 
Group Chief Executive in 2006, Andrew McIver was not 
awarded an increase in salary for the 2010-2011 financial year. 
Following a change in the taxation of pension contributions, 
Andrew McIver elected to receive the sum of  16,667 from  
his pension contribution as salary instead. The Remuneration 
Committee has decided that there will be no increase in 
Directors' salaries in the 2011-12 financial year.
Service contracts
The Company's policy on the duration of Directors' contracts  
is that for both Executive and Non-Executive Directors notice 
periods will be no more than one year served by the Company 
or the Director.
Andrew Mclver and Jim Wilkinson have service contracts, dated 
18 January 2006 and 21 January 2008 respectively, which provide 
for 12 months' notice by the Company or the Director and  
contain non-compete obligations. There are no payments or 
compensation on early termination of the contract, save that 
where a payment is made in lieu of notice and the Executive 
commences new employment during such a period, they are 
under an obligation to repay the Company any prorated amounts.
In the event of termination or constructive dismissal following  
a sale or reconstruction of Sportingbet each of the Executive 
Directors is entitled to the equivalent of 24 months' salary, 
bonus, pension contributions and other benefits payable under 
his respective service contract.
Peter Dicks, Brian Harris, Sean O'Connor and Nigel Payne, each 
of whom is a Non-Executive Director, has a contract for services 
with a termination period of 12 months' notice. It is  
the Company's policy that a proportion of their fee is paid in 
Sportingbet shares, which are to be retained until they cease  
to be a Director of the Company. In line with the policy of the 
Remuneration Committee the Company has agreed that this 
arrangement whereby the proportion of their fee is paid in 
Sportingbet shares shall terminate on 31 July 2012. Given that 
Sean O'Connor and Nigel Payne will resign on 16 December 
2011, it is anticipated that this arrangement will only apply to 
Peter Dicks and Brian Harris. It is the Company's policy that this 
arrangement shall not apply to new Non-Executive Directors.

By way of a variation agreement dated 17 January 2007 between Sportingbet and Sean O'Connor, and by way of a side letter dated 
8 January 2007 from Sportingbet to Peter Dicks, in the event of the sale or reconstruction of Sportingbet (or any Sportingbet Group 
company), both Sean O'Connor and Peter Dicks are entitled to be paid a sum in cash equivalent to the difference between  0.44 
and the price per Ordinary Share in Sportingbet agreed at completion of such sale or reconstruction of Sportingbet, multiplied  
by 500,000.
In December 2006, and in the case of Jim Wilkinson, on 1 February 2008, and on 14 September 2011 in the case of Rory Macnamara 
and Chris Moss, Sportingbet Plc granted rolling indemnities to all of its Directors and the Company Secretary, uncapped in amount, 
in relation to certain losses and liabilities which they may incur in the course of acting as Directors and Company Secretary of 
Sportingbet Plc or of one or more of its subsidiaries. These indemnities replace those previously granted on similar terms and 
continued to be in place as at 31 July 2011, or the date of grant if later.
Bonuses
The Company operates a bonus incentive scheme which applies, at differing rates, to the employment terms of the Executive 
Directors and members of senior management. Any payments under the scheme are subject to: (i) operating profit targets for the 
Group being achieved and; (ii) the discretion of the Board. 100% of annual salary can only be paid if stretch targets are achieved. 
The financial results for the last financial year did not reach the targeted bonus level and as a result no bonuses were paid.
The Remuneration Committee reviews the packages and varies individual elements when appropriate from year to year.  
The Remuneration Committee has policies and procedures in place to monitor the size of potential rewards.
Bonuses are included in termination payments on a case by case basis as determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Pensions
The Company makes employer contributions of 20% of Andrew McIver's salary and 17% of Jim Wilkinson's salary to their personal 
pension schemes. There are no Company pension arrangements in place.

GOVERNANCE
The 2009 Share Plan
Share options are now only granted under the 2009 Share Plan. The 2009 Share Plan was adopted on 22 July 2008 and awards 
were granted under the 2009 Share Plan to the Executive Directors and the Group's senior management team on 20 January 2009. 
The Company's policy to grant awards under the 2009 Share Plan is at the Remuneration Committee's discretion as and when 
considered appropriate.
Entitlements under the 2009 Share Plan comprise a loyalty element and a performance element in equal proportions.

award =  
1.2 x salary) Conditional upon
1 10% Loyalty

2 15% Loyalty

3 25% Loyalty

Shares comprised within the loyalty element of the award may only vest and be released if the participant remains employed by the 
Company as at 31 July 2010, 31 July 2011 and 31 July 2012 respectively. Shares comprised within the performance element of the 
award may only vest and be released if: (a) the participant remains employed by the Company as at 31 July 2010, 31 July 2011, and 
31 July 2012 respectively, and; (b) certain performance conditions are satisfied. 
The performance condition is based on the extent to which growth in the Company's earnings before interest, tax and amortisation 
(EBITA Growth ) exceeds RPI Growth over a financial year of the Company.
For the performance award to be exercisable in full, EBITA Growth must exceed RPI Growth by 15% per financial year compound. 
The proportion of the performance award exercisable increases on a straight-line sliding scale between 0 and 100% if EBITA 
Growth exceeds RPI Growth by any margin in excess of 5% over a financial year. The Remuneration Committee believes that, in 
relation to the 2009 Share Plan, EBITA Growth in excess of RPI Growth is the appropriate measure for determining the increase in 
value delivered to shareholders by the Company's Executive Directors and other senior executives for the period 2009-2012. The 
Remuneration Committee reviews the appropriateness of the performance measure and the specific target set when considering 
each new grant of performance awards.
During the current financial year, the Company has undertaken a remuneration and benchmarking study using industry 
consultants, MM&K. The Remuneration Committee has resolved to follow the recommendation of their report, including that 
payments due under existing incentive plans introduced in good faith as part of the Company's historical remuneration policy 
should be honoured. This means that the 2009 Share Plan under its current terms will expire in July 2012, with final awards being 
released in November 2012. 
Following its admission to the Official List, the Company intends to introduce a new share plan to replace the 2009 Share Plan 
which expires on 31 July 2012. Such share plan will be exclusively performance based.
Cash-based long-term incentive plan
In 2008, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the remuneration and benefits packages of certain key employees. As a result, 
a cash-based long-term incentive plan (LTIP ) was established and offered to the Executive Directors and a small number of key 
employees in order to retain such individuals. The LTIP pays a cash sum in August 2012 based on the relevant employee's gross 
salary. In line with the advice received from the specialist external consultants, MM&K, awards made prior to the Company's move 
to the Official List in good faith will be honoured. In order for the employee to receive such payment under the LTIP, they need to 
be in employment up to and including 31 July 2012. 
Following the recommendations of the external remuneration consultants, MM&K and to ensure compliance with the Code and 
investor protection group guidelines, the Company will not adopt similar schemes in the future. 40
