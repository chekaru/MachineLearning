Sportingbet Plc Annual Report 2012
Remuneration Report
Rory Macnamara 
Remuneration Committee Chairman
The report below describes in detail how we have set about meeting 
shareholder concerns. We have, for example, now produced a full 
performance schedule for the 2012 grants under the 2011 LTIP. 
This was initially delayed whilst market forecasts were reset following 
the acquisition of Centrebet in Australia and the disposal of the 
Company's Turkish language business in late 2011. Where we have 
been unable to meet commonly voiced concerns or the provisions 
of the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have provided our 
rationale and explained how we believe we comply with the 
underlying Code principles.
In 2011-12, the Executive Directors again received no increase 
in salary and no increase is planned for 2012-13. The Company 
exceeded the base target for operating profit for 2011-12, and the 
Committee awarded the Executive Directors an annual bonus at the 
basic level for the plan. During the year, the Executive Directors were 
both awarded performance related grants under the 2011 LTIP with 
a potential value of 150% of salary. Awards were also made to 
a number of senior managers whose roles were influential in 
delivering against Group strategy.
In the past year, the UK Government has been consulting on 
improvements to the disclosure and governance of Directors' 
remuneration in listed companies. This has culminated in the drafting 
of new legislation which replaces the current Directors' remuneration 
reporting rules entirely and introduces new shareholder voting 
powers for a forward looking policy report and an implementation 
report. The new rules will apply to companies reporting with year 
ends after 31 October 2013. Sportingbet will comply with these rules 
fully in our report for the year ending 31 July 2014. However, the 
Committee has decided to include in this year's report one aspect of 
the new reporting model that we feel will be helpful to shareholders 
- we have added additional columns in the remuneration table to 
allow the single figure of total remuneration for each director  to 
be reported. 
I am grateful for the time provided to both me and my predecessor, 
Peter Dicks, by major shareholders and shareholder institutions and 
for your continuing support. If any shareholder wishes to contact me 
in relation to the Company's Director and senior executive 
remuneration arrangements, please contact me at the Company's 
address via the Company Secretary.
Rory Macnamara
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
2 October 2012
Dear Shareholder
I joined the Sportingbet Remuneration Committee as its Chairman 
on 16 December 2011. This is the first time, therefore, that I have the 
pleasure of presenting to you, on behalf of the Board, the Directors' 
remuneration report. We will be asking for approval of this report 
for year ending 31 July 2012 at our Annual General Meeting in 
December 2012.
In 2011 we radically reviewed our remuneration policies. For five 
years following Sportingbet's exit from the US market and the 
resulting impact on profits and share price, Sportingbet remuneration 
policy has been focused on retention of key executives while we 
rebuilt the Company's business and stabilised its finances. Having 
achieved this turnaround, we decided last year that it was time 
to refocus remuneration to support long term value creation.
Central to this change in policy was the decision to ensure that 
long term rewards were appropriately performance based and 
compliant with best practice codes (the previous retention plans 
were partly based on service only) and to this end we sought and 
obtained approval at last year's AGM for a new Long Term Incentive 
Plan (the 2011 LTIP).
We consulted at length on the plan with major shareholders and 
voting agencies beforehand and, whilst the vote in favour of the new 
plan was 75.6% of shares participating (excluding abstentions) and 
the vote approving the remuneration report for 2011 was 86.1%, 
some of our shareholders expressed certain reservations about the 
design and communication of the new plan (particularly the absence 
of a performance schedule) and concerns about other aspects of 
remuneration policy. We also recognise that shareholders were 
making allowances for Sportingbet's recent move from AIM to a 
Premium Listing and the time it takes to achieve the more rigorous 
corporate governance demands of the latter.  32

Governance
Remuneration Report
Introduction
This Remuneration Report has been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Schedule 8 of 
the Large and Medium Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts 
& Reports) Regulations 2008 (the Regulations) and with the 
requirements of the United Kingdom Listing Authority listing rules.
To meet the requirement of the Regulations the report is divided 
into Unaudited Information and Audited Information. The Company's 
auditors are required to report to the Company's members on the 
auditable part of the Directors' Remuneration Report, and state 
whether in their opinion that part of the Directors' Remuneration 
Report has been properly prepared in accordance with the 2006 
Companies Act.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Compliance with Corporate Governance Code
The Remuneration Committee believes that the Company complies 
with the Main Principles of Section D (Remuneration) of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code (the Code ). In four respects 
remuneration policy departs from the provisions of the Code, 
namely:
 	 Notice periods of more than 12 months in the case of a change 
of control.
 	 The absence of performance conditions for the Long term Cash 
Plan and part of vesting under the 2009 Share Plan.
 	 A shorter vesting period for part of the first year's grant under 
the 2011 LTIP. 
 	 The absence of specific measures to encourage longer term 
share holding by Directors.
 	 The absence of specific clawback arrangements for annual 
bonuses.
In accordance with the Code and the requirements of the UK Listing 
Rules, this report explains in the relevant section below the details 
of the policy and the Committee's reasons for adopting it.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee currently comprises three members, 
all of whom are considered by the Board to be independent  taking 
into account Provision B.1.1 of the Code. As promised in last year's 
report, the Company has revisited the composition of the Committee 
in order to comply fully with the Code. On 16 December 2011, Rory 
Macnamara joined the Committee and took over its chair from Peter 
Dicks, who remains a member with Brian Harris. Chris Moss also 
joined the Committee. On the same date, Sean O'Connor and 
Nigel Payne resigned from the Board. 
Terms of reference
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee have been 
set by the Board, and include:
 	 To determine the remuneration and benefits, including incentive 
arrangements, of the Executive Directors, the Directors of 
divisional companies and other employees of similar status.
 	 To set targets for the performance related pay elements of the 
remuneration packages.
 	 To review recommendations from the Board on the overall 
remuneration and benefits policy of the Group, with the power 
and authority to amend it if appropriate.
 	 To have regard to the provisions of the Combined Code and 
associated guidance in its decision making.
The remuneration of the Chairman is set by the Board as a whole 
as is that of the Non Executive Directors. No Director is present 
when his own remuneration is discussed.
Committee advisers
During the year, the Remuneration Committee has taken advice 
internally from Ruth Smee, Group Head of Human Resources and 
Daniel Talisman, Company Secretary. External advice on the design 
of the 2011 LTIP was provided by MM&K, the executive remuneration 
consulting firm which conducted the remuneration market and policy 
review during the previous financial year. No other service was 
provided to the Company or Group by MM&K, which was appointed 
by the Committee.
Remuneration objectives and policy in the past and coming years
Executive Director and senior management remuneration in 
Sportingbet is designed to support the business strategy of the 
Company and its long term success. As reported last year, in 2011 
the Board changed the focus from retaining key executives following 
the exit from the US market (caused by the enactment of the 
Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act in 2006) to one of 
value creation  - essentially, shareholders and Directors share in the 
added valued generated from the successful implementation of the 
Company's strategy. This change reflected management's success 
in turning around the Company's fortunes. As reported last year, the 
Remuneration Committee accepted the advice of MM&K to honour 
remuneration arrangements (essentially long term share and cash 
plans) which pre dated the Company's move to the Official List in 
2010 and which may not have been compliant with the Combined 
Code on Corporate Governance (as was then in force). 33
Sportingbet Plc Annual Report 2012
It remains an objective to pay Directors and senior management 
competitively. This is characterised, broadly, as an upper quartile  
position in their relevant labour markets for both fixed and total 
remuneration. Our business in global online betting and gaming 
remains subject to uncertainty whilst a number of the Company's 
competitive markets determine whether or not to introduce 
licence issuing, regulated regimes and, if so, the form of such 
regulation and the corresponding tax rate. As a result, the Company 
continues to participate in a declining number of markets which are 
yet to introduce licences. The remuneration package needs to 
recognise this level of risk which is carried by the executives as well 
as the Company. Our policy is now to ensure that remuneration 
packages for executives are strongly performance linked, so that 
high levels of remuneration are only received if shareholders have 
benefited and the executives have achieved exceptional performance. 
The proportion of performance based remuneration in the total 
remuneration of the Executive Directors is shown in Chart A below. 
The Committee views projections of total remuneration in different 
performance scenarios to ensure that the total figure paid is not 
excessive and is justified by performance.
Chart A: Total remuneration of Executive Directors at 
achievement of target
Chief Executive
Not performance-based 39%
Performance-based 61%
Finance Director
Not performance-based 38%
Performance-based 62%
The previously awarded long term retention elements, which were 
not performance linked, have been paid out or vested in this 
financial year and it is not intended to repeat them.
The timescale and measures of the incentive programme have 
been chosen to provide the right emphasis on value creation and 
alignment with shareholders. In particular, the vesting of the new 
LTIP depends on cumulative EBITDA per share achievement, normally 
over three years (EBITDA per share is believed by the Committee to 
be the key driver of share value - a two or three year horizon is 
appropriate for the nature of the business) and the plan's provision 
of performance shares through the mechanism of nil cost  share 
options provides executives with a strong interest in the Company 
share price for up to ten years from the date of grant.
Remuneration policy: components of remuneration
Base Salary
2012-13 policy changes: no change from last year 
The Committee considers the particular labour markets in which 
the Executive Directors and members of senior management work, 
taking into account as appropriate the role, the competitive nature 
of the industry and company/division size. Decisions on base salary 
are made taking into account the individual's performance and 
contribution and salary increases elsewhere in the Group. The 
Executive Directors received no increase in salary in the 2011-12 
financial year, compared with an average employee increase of 2%.
The Committee has also proposed no increase in salary for the 
2012-13 financial year.
Annual Bonus
2012-13 policy changes: the Company is consulting with 
shareholders on the performance measures to be used
Executive Directors and senior managers participate in a Company 
annual bonus plan at different levels of opportunity depending on 
seniority. The payment to an Executive Director for achievement of 
a basic target is 75% of salary. No payment is made for performance 
below basic target. The maximum payment, for achievement of a 
stretch target is 100% of salary. The principal performance measure 
is operating profit against target. The KPIs included in the Company's 
Business Review are not used as targets in the annual bonus plan. 
These are leading indicators of performance and a number of 
uncertainties in the Company's markets make them currently 
unsuitable as bonus targets. In awarding payments, the 
Remuneration Committee may apply discretion, taking into account 
industry developments and the Company's response to them, 
including changes of policy towards business strategy and risk.
For 2011-12 the basic target was originally set as an operating profit 
of  37m, and the stretch target as an operating profit of  41m. 
These targets were revised upwards during the year to  41m and 
 45m respectively, to reflect the acquisition and the disposal which 
had been made and analysts' forecasts. Actual performance was 
 42m. The Committee decided to award a payment at the basic 
target level of 75% of salary.
In accordance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Committee has considered part deferment of bonus to 
be paid in cash or shares. It has concluded that immediate payment 
of bonus is necessary for the competitive and motivational impact 
and that an interest in the Company's shares is provided adequately 
by the long term incentive plans. Moreover, it does not believe at 
present that deferment is necessary to provide an opportunity of 
clawback in the circumstances of misstatement or misconduct 
because of the low risk of these occurring in this business. 
Bonuses in termination payments are determined by the 
Remuneration Committee on a case by case basis taking into account 
the recent performance of the Company and the Director. 34

Governance
Remuneration Report
Long term incentive plans
2012-13 policy changes: grants will now only be made under 
the 2011 LTIP approved at the 2011 AGM. In March 2012, the 
Remuneration Committee added a secondary measure of Earnings 
per Share to underpin the cumulative EBITDA measure, introduced 
graduated vesting (rather than cliff vesting) and published the full 
cycle performance vesting targets. This policy will continue for 
plan grants in the coming year.
In recent years, the Company has operated a number of long term 
cash and share plans. Their focus was primarily but not exclusively, 
aimed at retention in the special circumstances following the 
enactment of the Unlawful Internet Gaming Enforcement Act 
in the US in 2006. All of these are closed to further grants and 
all outstanding grants will have vested (or lapsed) by the end of the 
2012-13 financial year. Options granted under these closed plans 
which have vested but remain exercisable are shown in the Audited 
Information section later in this report. 
Two long term plans were open during the financial year 2011-12 
and are now closed:
Sportingbet Restricted Share Plan 2009 (2009 Share Plan)
The 2009 Share Plan was adopted on 22 July 2008 and awards of nil 
cost options were granted to the Executive Directors and the Group's 
senior management team on 20 January 2009. The plan is now 
closed and final vesting will be determined following the release 
of the Company's results for the 2011-12 financial year.
The plan was introduced at a time when retention was the 
main priority of the long term remuneration arrangements. In 
consequence, the vesting of awards was based only partially on 
performance, the rest being paid for loyalty (continued service).In 
addition, the options vested over three years rather than at the end 
of three years. Whilst these aspects of the plan are not in line with 
the provisions of Schedule A of the UK Corporate Governance Code, 
the awards were made before the Company had obtained a Premium 
Listing and was bound by the Code. In any case, the Committee 
believed the 2009 Share Plan was strongly in the interests of 
shareholders at the time of its introduction and initial grant 
because of the retention effect.
Plan structure
Entitlements under the 2009 Plan comprised a loyalty element and 
a performance element in equal proportions.
The maximum amount vesting from a grant was 120% salary.  
This amount vested over a period of three years in a series of 
tranches (see Chart B). The participant was required to be  
employed at the relevant year end date to receive either  
element in the vesting tranche.

Loyalty element 15%
Performance element 15%
At end of Year 2011-12
Loyalty element 25%

Total 100%
The performance condition was based on the extent to which 
growth in the Company's earnings before interest, tax and 
amortisation (EBITA Growth ) exceeded RPI Growth over a 
financial year of the Company. At the time of the plan's design, 
the Committee felt that EBITA was the principal driver of value 
in the Company.
For the performance tranche in a particular year to be exercisable 
in full, EBITA Growth had to exceed RPI Growth by 15% per financial 
year compound since grant. A minimum payment of 50% of the 
performance tranche would be awarded for 5% growth per annum, 
with intermediate levels calculated on a straight line basis. In 
2010-11 an EBITA of  38.1m was achieved, which represented a 
compound growth of 8.5% above RPI. As a result 66.9% of the 
performance element was paid out.
2008 Cash Based Long Term Incentive Plan (2008 Cash 
Retention Plan)
In 2008, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the remuneration 
and benefits packages of certain key employees. As a result, the 
2008 Cash Retention Plan was established and offered to the 
Executive Directors and a small number of key employees in order 
to retain such individuals. The Plan paid a cash sum in August 2012 
based on the relevant employee's gross salary, subject to continued 
employment in the Group up to and including 31 July 2012. The 
amount paid to Andrew McIver was  500,000 and to Jim Wilkinson 
was  293,500. These figures are included in the long term incentive 
vested figures shown in the Audited Information section of this 
report. The absence of a performance condition was not in line with 
the provisions of Schedule A of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
but the award was made before the Company had obtained a 
Premium Listing and was bound by the Code. The Committee 
believed its use was in the interests of shareholders at the time of the 
plan's introduction and initial grant because of its additional 
retention effect.
In line with the advice received from the specialist external 
consultants, MM&K, awards made in good faith prior to the 
Company's move to the Official List in May 2010 have been 
honoured. Following the recommendations of MM&K and to ensure 
compliance with the Code and investor guidelines, the Company will 
not adopt similar schemes in the future. The only long term incentive 
plan now in operation is the 2011 LTIP described below, which is 
entirely performance based. 35
Sportingbet Plc Annual Report 2012
Sportingbet Plc 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan (2011 LTIP)
This plan was approved by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting on 16 December 2011 and the first grants under the plan 
were made on 10 April 2012.
The purpose of the 2011 LTIP is to provide an incentive for Executive 
Directors and selected key executives to out perform in the 
achievement of value drivers and, as a reward, to receive an interest 
in ordinary shares in the Company. This interest is structured as an 
option which is exercisable over a period of seven years from vesting 
with a discretionary award of past dividends at exercise, maintaining 
attention to total shareholder return and creating alignment with 
shareholders' interests. 
The 2011 LTIP provides performance shares in the form of nil/nominal 
cost options which normally vest after three years depending on the 
achievement of two Company performance conditions. The normal 
maximum grant has a face value of the shares of 150% of salary, 
with 200% available for grants in exceptional circumstances such as 
recruitment. Under the 2012 grant, Andrew McIver was awarded a 
maximum of 1,986,755 shares; Jim Wilkinson was awarded 
a maximum of 1,192,053 shares. 
The principal performance measure is earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation of goodwill (EBITDA) per share - i.e. 
operating cash flow adjusted for year end accruals. The Committee 
believes that in a business where the major operational investment is 
in marketing, cash flow drives the value of the Company, as it creates 
the strength to grow organically and by acquisition, provides a 
cushion against risk and creates potential for cash returns to 
shareholders. In order to reduce the risk of creating higher but 
diluted earnings by increasing equity, EBITDA targets are set on a per 
share basis.
At the time of the AGM last year, the Company's business forecasts 
contained a number of uncertainties owing to external factors, which 
made it impossible to include the performance vesting schedule with 
the scheme rules. By March 2012, the picture had clarified and the 
Committee finalised the vesting schedule for the 2012 grant. This is 
shown in Chart C below. The Committee retains the discretion to 
vary these conditions during the performance cycle to maintain the 
level of challenge and to determine the extent to which the measure 
has been achieved following the approval of audited accounts for 
the final year of the performance cycle. Forecasting in the industry 
is inexact. The alternative to applying discretion in this way is either 
to set targets on a shorter timescale such as a year or to set a 
much wider performance range in the performance schedule.  
The Committee considers that a tightly defined three year target 
range, with responsibly applied discretion, is preferable to either  
of these alternatives. 
Transitional arrangement: in order to provide continuity of reward 
and retention effect from the previous two long term incentive 
plans, 50% of the first year's grant will vest after two years (subject 
to Company performance). Schedule A of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code expects vesting to occur in no less than three years 
in normal circumstances . However, the Committee believes that 
this transitional arrangement is justifiable in the circumstances and 
in the interests of shareholders.

1. Percentage of total grant vesting. Pro rated between these levels.
A secondary measure of Earnings per Share provides an underpin to 
the use of EBITDA. For the 2012 grant, the Committee has set an EPS 
target of 4.9p for the final year of the two year vesting element and 
5.4p for the final year of the three year vesting element. If EPS is 
80% of this target or below, only half the amount earned by EBITDA 
performance will vest; at target the full amount will vest, with 
straight line vesting between these levels.
The Committee currently intends to make grants early in 2013 for 
the new three year cycle starting in 2012-13. As happened for the 
grants made in 2012, we will communicate the targets to 
shareholders when they are known.
Pensions and benefits
2012-13 policy changes: no change from last year.
The Company makes employer contributions of 20% of Andrew 
McIver's salary and 17% of Jim Wilkinson's salary to their personal 
pension schemes and this policy will continue for 2012-13. There are 
no Company pension arrangements in place.
Executive Directors' benefits in kind comprise death in service 
cover of four times salary and private health insurance within the 
Group scheme.
Service contracts
All Directors have service contracts/engagement letters. These 
contracts do not have a fixed period. The Company's policy is that 
for both Executive and Non Executive Directors notice periods will 
be no more than one year, served by the Company or the Director.
Andrew Mclver and Jim Wilkinson have service contracts, dated 
18 January 2006 and 21 January 2008 respectively, which provide 
for 12 months' notice by the Company or the Director and contain 
non compete obligations. There are no payments or compensation 
on early termination of the contract by the Company, save that 
where a payment is made in lieu of notice and the executive 
commences new employment during such a period, they are 
required to repay the Company any prorated amounts.
In the event of termination or constructive dismissal following a 
sale or reconstruction of Sportingbet each of the Executive Directors 
is entitled to the equivalent of 24 months' salary, bonus, pension 
contributions and other benefits payable under his respective service 
contract. This entitlement is not in accordance with provision D.1.5 of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code. The contracts were drawn up 
before the Company had obtained a Premium Listing, at a time when 
it was not bound by the Code. The Board does not believe there 
would be a benefit to shareholders, on balance, in renegotiating the 
contracts at this time. 36
Sportingbet Plc Annual Report 2012
Governance
Remuneration Report
Peter Dicks and Brian Harris have contracts for services dated 1 February 2008 and 28 February 2003 respectively. Both have a termination 
period of 12 months' notice. Rory Macnamara and Chris Moss have contracts for services dated 26 June 2011 and 19 October 2011 
respectively. Both are terminable on six months notice after the initial period of three years. 
By way of a variation agreement dated 17 January 2007 between Sportingbet and Sean O'Connor, and by way of a side letter dated 8 
January 2007 from Sportingbet to Peter Dicks, in the event of the sale or reconstruction of Sportingbet (or any Sportingbet Group company), 
both Sean O'Connor and Peter Dicks are entitled to be paid a sum in cash equivalent to the difference between  0.44 and the price per 
ordinary share in Sportingbet agrees at completion of such sale or reconstruction of Sportingbet, multiplied by 500,000.
In December 2006 and in the case of Jim Wilkinson on 1 February 2008, and on 14 September 2011 in the case of Rory Macnamara and 
Chris Moss, Sportingbet Plc granted rolling indemnities to all of its Directors and the Company Secretary, uncapped in amount, in relation to 
certain losses and liabilities which they may incur in the course of acting as Directors and Company Secretary of Sportingbet Plc or of one or 
more of its subsidiaries. These indemnities replace those previously granted on similar terms and continued to be in place as at 31 July 2012.
Termination agreement
Sean O'Connor and Nigel Payne, who stood down at the 2011 AGM, each received a payment of six months fees under the terms of their 
contracts.

compared with: 
1. The FTSE 250 total return Index and
2. The FTSE 250 Leisure and Travel total return index 
These comparators were chosen by the Committee because the Company has been a constituent of both indices since its admission to the

Non Executive Directors' remuneration policy.
In year ending 31 July 2012, the Chairman, Peter Dicks received a fixed fee of  160,000 of which  40,000 was satisfied by the issue of 
Sportingbet shares (see below). This is unchanged for the coming year. Other Non Executive Directors receive a basic fee of  75,000 per 
annum (unchanged) with additional fees for the responsibilities of Senior Independent Director or committee chair. 
Up to 2011 it was the Company's policy that a proportion of Non Executive Directors' fees was paid in Sportingbet shares, to be retained 
until they cease to be a Director of the Company. The Committee decided that this was not an appropriate policy for a Premium listed 
company and, by agreement the arrangement with Mr Dicks and Mr Harris, terminated on 31 July 2012. The newer Non Executive Directors 
were appointed without this share payment arrangement.
External directorships
Executive Directors are allowed to hold external directorships but neither currently does. 37
