 this report has been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of regulation ii and schedule 8 of the large 
and Medium-sized companies and Groups (accounts 
and reports) regulations 2008 (the regulations) and of 
the combined code on corporate Governance 2008 (the 
combined code ). 
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
the remuneration committee
during the 52 weeks ended 25 april 2010 (the Year), 
the members of the remuneration committee (the 
committee), were: 
dave singleton (chairman) 
simon Bentley  
Malcolm dalgleish  
Keith Hellawell
simon Bentley, dave singleton and Malcolm dalgleish are 
independent non-executive directors, Keith Hellawell is 
non-executive chairman. 
the main responsibilities of the committee are 
summarised in the corporate Governance report on  
pages 47 and 48.
 
advisers
the committee has sought the advice and services of 
Freshfields llp when drafting the 2009 Bonus share 
scheme in which the executives currently participate 
and charles russell llp and deloittes in relation to the 
proposed new executive Bonus share scheme.
dave Forsey, the chief executive, Bob Mellors, the Group 
Finance director, and Mike ashley, the executive deputy 
chairman, have also advised or materially assisted the 
committee when requested.
 
remuneration policy
the committee has endorsed the provisions of section 1B 
of the combined code, and has had those provisions in 
mind when determining remuneration policies for the past, 
current and future years. policies and practice in respect 
of remuneration inevitably evolve over time and, while it is 
currently believed that the policies described in this report 
will apply in future years, they will be subject to regular 
review. 
the Group operates in a highly competitive retail 
environment, and the committee seeks to ensure that 
the level and form of remuneration is sufficient to attract, 
retain and motivate directors and senior managers of the 
quality and talent required to run the Group successfully. 
in order to maintain the Group's historic focus on growth, 
the committee has adopted a strongly performance based 
remuneration policy for executive directors, under which 
a large proportion of their remuneration will be dependent 
upon the Group's performance, and be paid in shares. 
accordingly, for executive directors other than Mike 
ashley, basic salaries have been set at a level below the 
lower quartile for a business of the size and complexity 
of the Group. during the Year the performance related 
elements of the remuneration packages consisted of 
participation in the Bonus share scheme and p erformance 
share plan. 
executive directors do not participate in a company 
pension arrangement in respect of which the company 
makes a financial contribution, and do not have the use of 
a company car or other similar benefits often available to 
executive directors.
the committee has reviewed the current incentive 
arrangements and in support of the above policy is 
recommending the establishment of a new executive 
Bonus share scheme. the executive Bonus share scheme 
has been designed to incentivise and reward executive 
directors in a way that is consistent with the Group's 
strategy of earnings growth and long term shareholder 
value. 
Full details of the proposed new executive Bonus share 
scheme are contained in the circular to shareholders 
accompanying this report and shareholders will be invited 
to approve the new executive share Bonus scheme at the 
forthcoming annual General Meeting. 
if the establishment of the executive Bonus share scheme 
is approved then it will replace the performance share 
plan and Bonus share scheme. in addition, a condition 
of participation in the proposed executive Bonus share 
scheme will be that the Bonus share scheme awards 
for executive directors for 2009-10 and 2010-11 will 
not be made; and all subsisting awards held under the 
performance share plan by the executive directors will 
lapse. 
if the committee were to change its policy on basic 
salaries and bonus strategy, then the committee's 
remuneration policy as set out above will not necessarily 
apply to any new appointment to the Board, or the existing 
Board going forward.
section 3 // MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE //
directors' remuneration report sports direct international plc // annual report 2010 // p.51
Mike ashley has agreed that he will not receive a salary 
for his role as executive deputy chairman, nor does 
he participate in the Bonus share scheme, and he will 
not participate in the executive Bonus share scheme if 
approved.
the committee intends to establish and thereafter 
maintain contact with major shareholders and 
representative groups where appropriate concerning 
remuneration matters.
the committee is at all times mindful of the company's 
social, ethical and environmental responsibilities, and is 
satisfied that current remuneration arrangements do not 
inadvertently encourage irresponsible behaviour.
the committee has reviewed the salaries, other 
remuneration and other employment conditions of senior 
and middle managers throughout the Group, and has taken 
them into account in considering directors salaries and 
the creation of new incentive schemes in order to create 
a sense of common purpose and sharing of success. the 
proposed executive Bonus share scheme targets mirror 
that of the Bonus share scheme which applies to all 
uK permanent employees of the Group in the uK retail, 
Brands and Head office on the same basis, including 
applying the same performance conditions, irrespective of 
seniority. 
the committee's remuneration policy in respect of the 
non-executive directors is to pay annual fees which reflect 
the responsibilities and duties placed upon them, whilst 
also having regard to market practice.
 
Basic salary
Basic salaries are reviewed annually. there was no 
increase in executive directors' salaries in the review in 
2009 and in april 2010 the committee decided again not 
to alter executive directors' salaries. executive directors' 
salaries have now been at the same level since 2002.
 
annual Bonus scheme
the committee has determined that no annual Bonus 
scheme will be operated for executive directors while the 
Bonus share scheme or proposed new executive Bonus 
share scheme is being operated. 
Mike ashley did not participate in the annual Bonus 
scheme for the Year, and will not participate in the Bonus 
share scheme or proposed new executive Bonus share 
scheme.
 
Bonus share scheme
the Bonus share scheme was approved at the company's 
annual General Meeting in september 2009 to motivate 
and help improve the retention of employees, to encourage 
employee participation in the shares of the company, to 
align the interests of employees and shareholders, and to 
drive underlying eBitda in line with company strategy. 
all permanent uK employees in uK retail, Brands and 
Head office with not less than one year of service at the 
beginning 2009-10 participated, irrespective of seniority. 
the bonus was structured in two stages. the first bonus is 
25% of base pay in shares at a notional share price of  1.00 
per share. the bonus target for 2009-10 was underlying 
eBitda of  155m (net of the cost of the scheme) and will 
vest after two years subject to continuous employment 
until then. 
the second bonus is 75% of base pay in shares at a 
notional share price of  1.25 per share. the second stage 
of the bonus is conditional upon the first bonus target 
being met in 2009-10, and the second bonus targets are: 
  underlying eBitda of  195m (net of the cost of the 
scheme) in 2010-2011, and
  underlying eBitda/net debt ratio of 2 or less at the end 
of 2010-11
the second bonus will vest, subject to continuous 
employment until then, 2 years after the second bonus 
target is met. 
the committee will adjust reported underlying Group 
eBitda each year during which the scheme is running 
for the purpose of the scheme to ensure consistency in 
the calculation of underlying eBitda and to ensure that 
underlying eBitda is a fair comparison year by year, for 
example, by eliminating the impact of acquisitions where 
the cost of acquisitions is not reflected in underlying 
eBitda.
underlying eBitda is as defined on page 26 and is not at 
constant foreign currency exchange rates. as outlined previously, the committee has determined 
that, if the proposed executive Bonus share scheme 
is approved at the company's annual General Meeting 
in september 2010 and implemented with effect from 
the beginning of the current financial year, then this 
will replace the Bonus share scheme for the executive 
directors. in this case, the Bonus share scheme awards 
for executive directors for 2009-10 and 2010-11 will not be 
made.
 
the p erformance share plan
the p erformance share plan was adopted at the time of 
the admission of the company to the official list and to 
trading on the london stock exchange in 2007. 
the maximum number of shares that an executive director 
may acquire pursuant to share awards granted to him 
in any financial year may not have an aggregate market 
value, as measured at the date of grant, exceeding 400% of 
his annual basic salary. 
there are currently three grants of awards in respect of 
the periods 2007 to 2010, 2008 to 2011 and 2009 to 2012 
under the performance share plan. the vesting of 50% of 
the awards is subject to a performance target based on the 
earnings per share (eps ) growth of the company over a 
three year performance period. the remaining 50% of the 
awards are subject to a performance target based on the 
company's total shareholder return (tsr ) over the same 
performance period when compared against a group of 
comparator companies. 
the number of shares that will vest under the eps tranche 
of each award will be determined as follows:
EpS Growth
percentage of 
shares in EpS 
tranche that vest
Below 19% per annum 0
19% per annum 
(threshold )
25
24% per annum (t arget ) 50
29% per annum (stretch ) 100
 
shares comprised in the eps tranche will vest on a 
straight-line basis for performance between threshold and 
t arget and between t arget and stretch.
the percentage of the shares comprised in the tsr 
tranche that vest will be determined by reference to the 
company's tsr ranking within the comparator group at 
the end of the performance period as follows:
TSR Ranking
percentage of 
shares in TSR 
tranche that vest
upper quartile 100
Median 25
Below median 0
 
shares comprised in the tsr tranche will vest on a 
straight-line basis for performance between median and 
upper quartile.
the initial comparator group comprised the following 
companies
  Marks & spencer plc
  Kingfisher plc
  next Group plc
  Home retail Group plc
  dsG international plc
  the carphone Warehouse Group plc
  signet Group plc
  Kesa electrical plc
  debenhams plc
  n Brown Group plc
  Galiform plc
  carpetright plc
  Halfords Group plc
  W H smith plc
  JJB sports plc
  HMV Group plc
  Jd sports Fashion plc
  Blacks leisure Group plc
  Mothercare plc
 
Mothercare plc has replaced umbro plc in the comparator 
group following its acquisition by nike and subsequent 
delisting. 
subject to satisfaction of applicable performance 
conditions and continued employment, awards will vest 
at the end of the performance period and vested share 
awards will be released to participants automatically as 
soon as practicable after the date the shares vest.
Bonus share scheme (continued)
section 3 // MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE //
directors' remuneration report
continued sports direct international plc // annual report 2010 // p.53
the committee determined that, upon the vesting of 
any award, a participant will receive additional shares 
representing the gross value of dividends as if they had 
been paid on those shares and reinvested during the 
performance period.
in the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement (other 
than a scheme to create a new holding company for the 
company having substantially the same shareholders as 
the company) or voluntary winding-up of the company, 
share awards will vest following such an event to the 
extent the performance conditions have been met but 
on a time pro-rated basis. share awards may also by 
agreement, be exchanged for equivalent share awards or 
options over shares in the acquiring company.
as outlined previously, the committee has determined 
that, if the proposed executive Bonus share scheme is 
approved at the company's annual General Meeting in 
september 2010 and implemented with effect from the 
beginning of the current financial year, then this will 
replace the performance share plan. in this case, all 
subsisting awards held under the performance share plan 
by the executive directors will lapse.
 
pension 
executive directors are entitled to participate in a 
stakeholder pension scheme under which the company 
makes no contribution. 
 
share ownership policy 
the committee believes it to be important that executive 
directors have a significant holding in the capital of the 
company. 
the executive directors' currently each own 1 million 
shares in the company. in order to participate in the 
proposed executive share Bonus plan, the executive 
directors will be required to maintain a level of 
shareholding in the company equivalent to one year's 
salary while they remain employed by the company.
 
contracts of service
on 11 February 2007, each executive director entered 
into a new service agreement with the company. the 
agreements became effective on admission. 
these contracts reflect the committee's policy on the 
duration of executive directors service contracts and on 
notice periods and termination payments.
each executive director's employment is terminable by 
either party on 12 months' written notice. the company 
may elect to terminate the employment of dave Forsey 
and/or Bob Mellors by making a payment in lieu of notice 
equal to the basic salary that the director would have 
received during the notice period or, if notice has already 
been given, during the remainder thereof.
the company may elect to pay any payment in lieu of 
notice by monthly instalments during the outstanding 
notice periods, and if the director obtains alternative 
employment or provides services pursuant to a 
consultancy agreement while such payments are being 
made (the director being obliged to use his best efforts 
to obtain such employment), each instalment falling due 
after the commencement of such employment or provision 
of services is reduced by one twelfth of the annual 
remuneration or fees received by the director in respect of 
that alternative employment or consultancy. 
any entitlement to benefits under any share related 
incentive scheme are determined in accordance with the 
rules of that scheme.
each executive director's service contract automatically 
terminates on the date that the director reaches such age 
as is determined by the Board from time to time as the 
retirement age for executive directors.
the non-executive directors have each entered into a 
letter of appointment with the company, which became 
effective in the case of simon Bentley, on admission, and 
in the case of Malcolm dalgleish, dave singleton and 
Keith Hellawell on execution. details of the letters of 
appointment are set out below:

simon Bentley received an annual fee of  144,000 as 
acting chairman. as from 24/11/2009 receives  50,000 as 
a non-executive director.  non-executive directors do not and are not entitled to 
participate in any bonus or share scheme. 
each non-executive director's appointment (other than 
the chairman) is for an initial period that expires on 
the date of the company's first annual General Meeting 
after appointment. the appointment of simon Bentley 
was renewed at the aGM on 9 september 2009 and will 
continue for a term of three years from then and then 
terminate unless renewed prior to the expiry of that term. 
Malcolm dalgleish, who is scheduled to retire at the next 
aGM has made it known that he does not intend to seek  
reappointment.
notwithstanding renewal for a three year term, the 
appointment of each of simon Bentley, Malcolm dalgleish 
and dave singleton may be terminated at any time by 
either party on one months' written notice. 
each of the appointments of the non-executive directors 
may also be terminated in accordance with the articles of 
association of the company, and immediately in certain 
prescribed circumstances (including the bankruptcy of the 
non-executive director). 
non-executive directors are subject to confidentiality 
undertakings without limitation in time. non-executive 
directors are not entitled to receive any compensation on 
the termination of their appointment. 
 
non-executive directorships
the Board recognises that executive directors may be 
invited to become non-executive directors of other 
companies, and that the experience and knowledge 
gained as a result of such appointments are of benefit to 
the company. accordingly, the Board has agreed that the 
executive directors may accept one such appointment, 
and retain any fees payable in respect thereof, subject to 
there being no conflict of interest. no executive director 
currently holds any such appointment. 
 
the following graph, required by the regulations, 
shows the company's total shareholder return since 
admission against that of the Ftse 250 index (excluding 
investment trusts). the committee considered this an 
appropriate index against which to compare the company's 
performance as it is widely accepted as a national measure 
and includes the companies that investors are likely to 
consider alternative investments.
