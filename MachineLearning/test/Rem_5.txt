 DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT
the remuneration package for senior executives is highly performance-based, 
with the performance element paid in shares, which encourages the growth 
and long-term success of the group. the executive directors' basic salaries 
have been set at a level well below the lower quartile for a business of the size 
and complexity of the group and have remained the same since 2002. senior 
executive salaries will not increase in 2013 / 2014. the senior executives enjoy 
no additional benefits.
the executive and employee bonus share schemes are closely aligned and 
reflective of the one t eam  ethos. to drive sustained business performance, 
instead of granting smaller awards on an annual basis, larger upfront awards are 
granted which only vest if significant and consistent growth is delivered year 
on year. the extended time horizon for vesting of awards for the 2011 executive 
share bonus scheme is six years (in 2017). 
clear, published and stretching performance targets must be fully satisfied 
before any proportion of the share awards vest. aligned to the company's 
performance culture, the executive and employee share schemes are designed 
on the basis that awards should vest in full for achieving the upper end of stretch 
targets (i.e. with an  all or nothing' vesting schedule) rather than providing for 
a lower level of vesting for meeting a threshold target rising to full vesting for 
achieving the stretch targets (i.e. a scaled vesting schedule). 
in 2014 the r emuneration committee intend to raise the required shareholding 
value of executive directors to two times annual salary while employed by  
the company. 
the r emuneration committee strongly believes that this simple and transparent 
incentive framework is aligned with the company strategy for growth. w e 
believe that this remuneration strategy has also directly driven historic 
out-performance of the stretch targets set by the r emuneration committee, 
cemented a one t eam  culture across all levels of the company, supported 
the group's success and has clearly led to increased shareholder value since 
inception in 2009. in this regard, our remuneration arrangements are tailored 
to the culture and strategy of the company, take account of the current and 
forecasted economic climate, and are already providing a strong platform for the 
ongoing long-term success of the company.
this report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of r egulation 
ii and schedule 8 of the large and medium-sized companies and groups 
(accounts and r eports) r egulations 2008 (the r egulations) and of the corporate 
governance code.
the remuneration policy of the company is very closely aligned to its commercial strategy for long term profitable growth, its very 
strong employee performance culture and a reward ethos of one t eam .

THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
the r emuneration committee consists of simon bentley, dave singleton, claire 
Jenkins and charles mccreevy who are independent non-executive directors, 
and keith hellawell who is the non-executive chairman.
the role and main responsibilities of the committee are detailed in the corporate 
governance r eport on page 45.
attendance at the meetings held during the year is detailed on page 43.
ADvISERS
dave forsey, the chief executive, bob mellors, the group finance director, and 
mike ashley, the executive deputy chairman, have also advised or materially 
assisted the committee when requested.
REMUNERATION POLICY
the aim of the group is to achieve long-term success and increase shareholder 
value. this is underpinned by the main principles of the r emuneration 
committee to ensure policies and practices are in place to encourage 
performance which will in turn help achieve this success.
the committee has endorsed the provisions of section d of the uk corporate 
governance code, and has had those provisions in mind when determining 
remuneration policies for the past, current and future years.
the retail environment in which the group operates is highly competitive so 
the committee ensures that the level and form of remuneration is sufficient to 
attract, retain and motivate directors and senior managers of the quality and 
talent required to run the group successfully.
the remuneration policy for executive directors is highly performance-based 
which links the executive directors' reward to the growth and long-term success 
of the group. all performance-based remuneration is paid in shares to align the 
interest of the executive directors with the interest of shareholders.
basic salaries have been set at a level well below the lower quartile for a 
business of the size and complexity of the group and have remained the 
same since 2002. during the year the performance-related elements of the 
remuneration packages consisted of participation in the executive bonus share 
scheme, although there are no other benefits. f ull details are on page 48.
mike ashley does not receive a salary for his role and has not received a bonus.
the committee consults major shareholders and representative groups where 
appropriate concerning remuneration matters.
the committee is at all times mindful of the company's social, ethical and 
environmental responsibilities, and is satisfied that current remuneration 
arrangements do not inadvertently encourage irresponsible behaviour.
the committee has reviewed the salaries, other remuneration and other 
employment conditions of senior and middle managers throughout the group, 
and has taken them into account in considering directors' salaries and the 
creation of new incentive schemes in order to create a sense of common 
purpose and sharing of success. the executive bonus share scheme 
performance targets mirror those to be applied to awards under the bonus share 
scheme which will apply to all uk permanent employees of the group in uk 
r etail, brands and head office on the same basis.
the committee is mindful that any bonus arrangements are balanced against 
delivering sustainable growth in earnings for shareholders.
the committee's remuneration policy in respect of the non-executive directors 
is to pay annual fees which reflect the responsibilities and duties placed upon 
them, while also having regard to market practice.

ANNUAL BONUS SCHEME 
the committee has determined that no annual bonus scheme will be  
operated for executive directors while the executive bonus share scheme is 
being operated. 
ExECUTIvE BONUS SHARE SCHEME
the executive bonus share scheme was approved at the company's  
annual general meeting in september 2010 to motivate and help improve the 
retention of the executives and to drive underlying group ebitda in line with 
group strategy.
subject to continued employment, each executive and two members of senior 
management will have the right to exercise their options to acquire one million 
shares each in the company from august 2013 as the company has attained the 
following targets:
  underlying ebitda of  195m (net of the cost of the scheme) in 2010-2011; 
and
  underlying ebitda /net debt ratio of 2 or less at the end of 2010-11.
a further executive bonus share scheme is currently in operation. each 
executive and two members of senior management have been granted an 
award of one million shares each which will vest if the company attains all the 
following targets: 
  underlying ebitda of  215m in 2012
  underlying ebitda of  250m in 2013
  underlying ebitda of  260m in 2014
  underlying ebitda of  300m in 2015
  individual satisfactory employment performance
the bonus will vest in 2017 subject to continuous employment to this date. the 
targets and vest dates are in line with the employee bonus share scheme.
in respect of each relevant year, the committee will adjust reported underlying 
group ebitda for the purpose of the scheme to ensure consistency in the 
calculation of underlying ebitda and to ensure that underlying ebitda is a fair 
comparison year by year, for example, by eliminating the impact of acquisitions 
where the cost of acquisitions is not reflected in underlying ebitda .
underlying ebitda is as defined on page 33 and is not at constant foreign 
currency exchange rates.
in the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement (other than a scheme to 
create a new holding company for the company having substantially the same 
shareholders as the company) or voluntary winding-up of the company, share 
awards will vest in full following such an event to the extent the performance 
conditions have been met. if the performance conditions have not been met the 
awards will lapse.
PENSION
the executive directors are entitled to participate in a stakeholder pension 
scheme under which the company makes a contribution although they have 
opted out of this. 
SHARE OWNERSHIP POLICY 
the board believes it is important that executive directors have a significant 
holding in the capital of the company.
in order to participate in the executive bonus share scheme, there are current 
internal guidelines that the executive directors will be required to maintain a 
minimum level of shareholding in the company equivalent to one year's salary 
while they remain employed by the company. however these guidelines can 
be waived with the permission of the board. the board applied their discretion 
during 2013 and allowed dave forsey and bob mellors to sell their remaining 
shares. permission to sell the shares was granted by the board as they had the 
knowledge that both dave forsey and bob mellors would shortly receive a large 
number of shares due to the vesting of the executive bonus share scheme.
the sale of the shares by the directors was reported in an rns announcement 
and also on the company's website.
SERvICE CONTRACTS
all executive directors are employed on a rolling 12 month contract which is 
terminable by either party on 12 months' written notice. the company may elect 
to terminate the employment of dave forsey and/or bob mellors by making a 
payment in lieu of notice equal to the basic salary that the director would have 
received during the notice period or, if notice has already been given, during the 
remainder thereof. 
details of the letters of appointment are set out below:

any entitlement to benefits under any share-related incentive scheme is 
determined in accordance with the rules of that scheme.
each executive director's service contract automatically terminates on the date 
that the director reaches such age as is determined by the board from time to 
time as the retirement age for executive directors.
